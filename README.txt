NOTE: A new CFQueryReader, supporting Ext5, is available in an ExtJS5 branch.

The CFQueryReader directory should be setup as a site root for testing. 
All pathing relates to this folder as the site root. You will require
the ColdFusion 8 or higher Development server to properly call the CFC,
and thecfartgallery datasource (part of the demo applications).

The examples use the 'blog' MySQL datasource that is included in the 
'db' folder.

There are now two separate query reader files. One is for versions of ExtJS
prior to version 4. There were tested with Ext 2.x and Ext 3.x. The latest
supports Ext 4.x, and has been tested through 4.1 RC2.
