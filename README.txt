The CFQueryReader directory should be setup as a site root for testing. 
All pathing relates to this folder as the site root. You will require
the ColdFusion 8 or higher Development server to properly call the CFC,
and thecfartgallery datasource (part of the demo applications).

The examples use the 'blog' MySQL datasource that is included in the 
'db' folder.
