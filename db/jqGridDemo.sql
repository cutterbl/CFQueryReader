 ('9856EAEE-3048-71C2-17200391BC54EA09','The History of Cutter and Computers: Part I','\r\n<h2>The Beginning</h2>\r\n<p>\"Who\'s this guy Cutter?\" Fair question. One that\'ll take more than one entry to answer. Today I\'ll stick to the very basic, and the tech side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My name is Stephen Gregory Blades, Jr. (aka Cutter), named for my father (of course). I\'m considered, by some, to be an old man in the tech world at 36 years. I was born in <a href=\"http://www.roanoke.com\" target=\"_blank\">Roanoke, Virginia</a>. My mother, sister, and I moved to the <a href=\"http://www.atlanta.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Atlanta, Georgia</a> metro area when I was six, where we moved all over until I graduated <a href=\"http://www.marietta-city.k12.ga.us/mhs/index.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Marietta High School</a> at 17.</p>\r\n','2006-04-14 08:17:00','<p>A month after graduation I joined the <a href=\"http://www.goarmy.com\" target=\"_blank\">U.S. Army</a>, starting off in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field_artillery\" target=\"_blank\">Field Artillery</a> as a Fire Direction Control Specialist, then switching over to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_intelligence\" target=\"_blank\">Military Intelligence</a> as an Intelligence Analyst. I\'m going to stop giving you the Army rundown now, because that\'s 9+ years to go over. We\'ll save that for a rainy day, perhaps. I will tell you that I got my nickname while in the Army (It stuck, Copi. Thanks, wherever you are.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started off with three of the best, and worst, computers ever invented. All three changed computing in some way. The first was a <a href=\"http://www.old-computers.com/museum/computer.asp?c=191\" target=\"_blank\">Commodore Pet</a>, which my Great Uncle Gil had brought to me from <a href=\"http://www.nasa.gov\" target=\"_blank\">NASA</a>. I blew the circuit breakers in the apartment when I tried to splice a new power cable to it. I was 11. The Pet had the screen and keyboard attached, and was larger than my black & white television set in my room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My second computer I bought for myself when I was 12. I won $100 in a radio station drawing at a balloon race on my birthday, and promptly cashed the check and went out and bought the <a href=\"http://oldcomputers.net/ts1000.html\" target=\"_blank\">Timex Sinclair 1000</a>. It had a touch pad keyboard, hooked up to my tape deck for data backup, plugged into a standard TV for a monitor, and I eventually got an additional <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAM\" target=\"_blank\">RAM</a> module, bumping me up to 16K. This is when I started learning <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC_programming_language\" target=\"_blank\">BASIC</a>, from a book my mother bought for me after a lot of twelve year old nagging. These computers are still around today, used by home robotics enthusiasts world-wide as the brain of their creations.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My third system (which my mother purchased) was the <a href=\"http://oldcomputers.net/adam.html\" target=\"_blank\">Coleco Adam</a>. She bought the system at the brand new Circuit City that had opened on Highway 41 in Marietta, GA (I think it\'s a strip club now.) It had a seven day return warranty, and <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coleco\" target=\"_blank\">Coleco</a> went out of business on day eight. It had a built in tape drive, and came with the keyboard and a daisy wheel printer (plus a cartridge slot for ColecoVision games, which were way cooler than the Atari), plus two game controllers. Christmas break, I rode my bike five miles down Highway 41 to buy my first modem, which I promptly used to dial into The Tardis, one of Atlanta\'s most frequented Bulletin Board Systems, run by my buddy Jay Finch. The modem got fried, that summer, when my mother left the system plugged in during an electrical storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So ends \"The History of Cutter and Computing: Part I\".

I told them I wanted to work with computers, so they sat me down to watch a little movie, off a 12 inch Laser Disc, about the wonders and joys of working as a <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/sys/land/tacfire.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Tactical Fire Direction Control Specialist</a> in the <a href=\"http://www.branchorientation.com/fieldartillery/home.html\" target=\"_blank\">Field Artillery</a>. Eight months later, while going through Advanced Individual Training in <a href=\"http://sill-www.army.mil/\" target=\"_blank\">Fort Sill, OK</a>, I discovered that these highly advanced system [note the sarcasm here] were invented during the <a href=\"http://www.korean-war.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Korean War</a>, sat on the back of a five-ton truck hauling a noisy generator, and gave it\'s user a battlefield life expectency of about thirty seconds. (This machinery has been replaced since my time.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, so the Army, computers, and myself, didn\'t get off to the rockin\' start I had been hoping for. But, that was OK. I was young (18 my first tour of duty) and stupid, and really only wanted to get drunk and laid in those days anyway.</p>','2006-04-28 08:48:00','In \'90, when I came back stateside from Germany (to Fort Sill again), I was blessed enough to be placed in a <a href=\"http://www.gruntsmilitary.com/brigade.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Brigade</a> Headquarters. At that echelon, when not out on maneuvers, a TacFire Specialist would work in the Brigade\'s rear operations center. I had to learn to do things like supply requests and training schedules. These were typically done on <a href=\"http://www.ibm.com\" target=\"_blank\">IBM</a> clones running <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS\" target=\"_blank\">DOS</a> based programs, and we may have even had a system or two running <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryDesktop.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 2.0</a>, but this is quite some time back so my memory is sketchy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When my first four-year tour was up I decided to change Military Operation Specialties. After some re-training for my new position I was assigned to <a href=\"http://www.ftmeade.army.mil/\" target=\"_blank\">Fort Meade, MD</a>, where I began training on <a href=\"http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/2009\" target=\"_blank\">Sparc 10 Unix</a> systems. I also began tooling around this new thing called the World Wide Web, in a free browser called <a href=\"http://archive.ncsa.uiuc.edu/mosaic.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mosaic</a>. It was fairly cut and dry, text-only kinda stuff, until the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html-spec/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML 2.0</a> specification came out supporting the image tag. Mosaic updated their browser, <a href=\"http://www.netscape.com\" target=\"_blank\">Netscape</a> came along (it was still free then), and people went image happy. Add in the changes to the table tag in the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/html3/Contents.html\" target=\"_blank\">HTML 3.0</a> spec and, Wham!, nothing is ever the same. Around this time is when I started learning HTML, gleaning what I could from various sites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also in this time frame, I bought my first PC. It came with <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryDesktop.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 3.11</a> and a 3 month trial subscription to <a href=\"http://myhome.prodigy.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Prodigy</a>. A friend of mine later upgraded my system with the final beta for <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/WinHistoryDesktop.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">Windows 95</a>. Wow!, thanks <a href=\"http://www.billgates.com\" target=\"_blank\">Bill</a>. This changes everything. I would sit at my system from the time I got off work til two, maybe three in the morning. Just downloading this and that, trying new programs, or marveling at this new thing called \'online porn\' (which really wasn\'t that new, it had been around in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARPANET\" target=\"_blank\">ARPANET</a> days, and even had entire <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulletin_board_system\" target=\"_blank\">BBS</a>s devoted to it). At some point I switched providers over to <a href=\"http://www.aol.com\" target=\"_blank\">America Online</a>, then switched back to an actual Internet Service Provider when I got sick of the \'directed\' content aspect of the <a href=\"http://searchwebservices.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid26_gci214203,00.html\" target=\"_blank\">Online Service Providers</a> of the day (AOL, Prodigy, <a href=\"http://www.compuserve.com\" target=\"_blank\">Compuserve</a>, etc.) A basic ISP gave you a browser and a connection and let you find your own way, which I liked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend had also given me copies of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Word\" target=\"_blank\">Word</a> and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0782113273/102-9997092-3649711?v=glance&amp;n=283155\" target=\"_blank\">Access 2.0</a>a. I became fascinated with database programming. This is when I was also introduced to the <a href=\"http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/WYSIWYG.html\" target=\"_blank\">WYSIWYG</a> HTML editors (like HoTDoG), which (at the time) was the greatest thing since sliced bread. And don\'t forget <a href=\"http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=Corel3/Products/Display&amp;pfid=1047024307383\" target=\"_blank\">PaintShop Pro</a>, a budding web developer\'s dream come true! But, tools quickly got replaced in those days.

Adam is an interesting character, and a lot of fun to speak with. He has a varied background from many different geographical areas, and currently works out of L.A. Aaron spoke on the CF Application framework, <a href=\"http://www.horwith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Horwith</a> on <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/\" target=\"_blank\">Flex</a>, and many other great speakers doing quick, 15 minute presentations on various Adobe products.\r\n\r\nThis morning, after a late wake up, I met up with Aaron and headed for the conference center. While Aaron was registering (I registered last nigt) I stepped out for a smoke with Simon Horwith. He filled me in on the \'secret\' he couldn\'t let out of the bag last night. <a href=\"http://www.forta.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Forta</a> is going to announce (in just a moment) what went live on the Adobe site at midnight, the final release of Flex 2.0.

 ('1B6B4D48-3048-71C2-17831BC4F8D7F6FE','CFUnited: Flex 101','Welcome from the ColdFusion/Flex Coding Kitchen. Idiot-boy (me) forgot to pack the powercord for my laptop when I transferred things into my new CFUnited backpack. The good news? Forty minutes into the 3-hour session and they are still covering the install for all of the various components that are needed (I did this in advance since I signed up for the class a month ago).\r\n\r\nWe know now, from <a href=\"http://www.forta.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Forta</a>\'s keynote, that <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/\" target=\"_blank\">Flex Builder 2.0</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/shockwave/download/download.cgi?P1_Prod_Version=ShockwaveFlash&promoid=BIOW\" target=\"_blank\">Flash Player 9</a>, and all of the other nifty stuff involved (i.e.: <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/support/coldfusion/downloads_updates.html\" target=\"_blank\">CF 7.0.2 updater</a>, etc.) were officially released at midnight last night.\r\n\r\nOK, one hour in and we\'re now starting some training. Our presenter is showcasing an example of an online MP3 player designed in Flex. This leads into discussion on the Eclipse based Flex Builder IDE, showing the basics of the design view.\r\n\r\nThis example app is using web services calls to a CF component. He\'s done this to show that weeb services calls are possible for data access (through PHP, ASP, etc), though it\'s possible (even preferrable) to access the CFC through Flash Remoting or Flash Data Services. Ben had stated, in the keynote, several advantages to integrating CF and Flex, including using FDS for real-time data record state management within multiple concurrent transactions. This functionality is <u>only</u> available with ColdFusion.\r\n\r\nNow going through creating an app from scratch, utilizing Flex\'s wizards to \'create\' the initial application. This wizard will generate your beginning data access objects for the tables of the db specified, with CRUD methods and all. You can set up pages (views) with reference to tables, query objects, foreign keyed data, etc. Some confusion among other attendees about the difference between the query builder and the form designer, which appear very similar and give you a great deal of flexability for quickly designing your views, even around complex data sets. It\'ll even set up a basic (no true starting functionality) authentication set up on specified page views when you ask for it. He hit \'Finish\', watched the files auto-generate, hit \'Run\', and...BAM! There it was! Basic, but functional. Next he adjusted the login/logout methods in the auto-generated CFC, recompiled, and BAM! There it was. So simple. I can\'t tell you how smokin\' this is.\r\n\r\nWonder what we could have gotten through if everyone had started prepared?','2006-06-28 11:59:00',NULL,'CFUnited-Flex-101','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2423,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 ('1FC333D3-3048-71C2-179214B3194246D3','Day 2','Well, yesterday was interesting. First, my three hour Flex Coding Kitchen session was, unfortunately, a waste of time. General consensus from the crowd is that we could have learned more from five minutes with the online documentation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of online, the conference center\'s wireless access was pretty blown after 11 am.\r\n\r\nThe session on usability was cool, but my sessions on ansynchronus gateways and beginning web services were a little lower level than I really expected.\r\n\r\nOn the high side, the Celebrity Death Match between <a href=\"http://www.horwith.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Horwith</a> and <a href=\"http://www.halhelms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hal Helms</a> was outstanding.

Really glad he had the chance to come across the pond and join us yanks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I need to pay more attention to this session on MVC from <a href=\"http://www.clearsoftware.net\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Rinehart</a>, so I\'m going to sign off for now.

 ('261C3450-3048-71C2-17E1AAC9F9CC1CC0','Day 3','OK, I guess I should start off by saying that most of the speakers have been great speakers, who are well versed in the materials they are presenting. My selection of sessions (being as I\'ve never attended one of these affairs) has just been off the mark. I\'ve taken several \'advanced\' sessions that really weren\'t as advanced as I expected. I\'ve heard about many great sessions here, such as the sessions from <a href=\"http://www.ashenfelter.com/\" target=\"_blank\">John Paul Ashenfelter</a> on <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development\" target=\"_blank\">Agile development</a>. But, I missed these by attending some sessions on Web Services and Object Persistence that I actually didn\'t really need to go to. Not to say I haven\'t learned anything, because I have, but not as much as I intended to.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.clearsoftware.net\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Rinehart</a>\'s preso on MVC was fantastic, where he created a very simple blog app, db and all, from the ground up using <a href=\"http://www.model-glue.com\" target=\"_blank\">Model-Glue Unity</a>, in about 10 minutes flat. Really exciting stuff!\r\n\r\nI also sat down for about an hour with <a href=\"http://www.buntel.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Buntel</a>. For those who don\'t yet know, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has lured Tim back to the fold as the Sr Marketing Manager for CF. This is huge for CF development, and he will be working hard to put out the word on the extreme value to CF as a platform. Adobe is putting some serious power behind our environment of choice, and Tim is just the right guy to give us the push at the enterprise level.\r\n\r\nOn another note, <a href=\"http://www.newatlanta.com\" target=\"_blank\">BlueDragon</a> just finished their keynote, mapping out the last five years with BD, and showing off some of the new features of BD 7 (soon to be in beta). A huge thing for advanced developers will be the inclusion of the CFTHREAD/CFJOIN tags, which give us the ability to create simultaneously processing threads and act upon data that might be returned. I sat down for awhile with Vince afterwards to tell him that a lot of developers came out of the preso going \'we might need to give BD a closer look.\' He also hinted at what may come with another BD release in 2007, and on how NewAtlanta is listening very carefully to the needs of CF developers. Definitely worth watching.\r\n\r\nBTW, Mark Drew is the bomb! Not only is he a riot, but he\'s a great guy to just bounce things off of. He attended the Ducktyping session that Sean Corfield took over for Hal Helms. Before walking in he was trying to get his head even wrapped around the concept. Being from a Java dev background, which is strictly typed, the idea of not typing anything seemed not only odd but totally wrong. After the session he seemed a lot more open to the concept. Not really a good practice for a newbie, but definitely something to be considered from an advanced development standpoint. Something that came up in Charlie Arehart\'s Web Services Tips and Tricks session was \'Is there a way to introspect Web Services from within CFEclipse?\' I asked Mark on the next break and the answer is \'yes\'. Look for me to blog on this more in depth in the future.\r\n\r\nYesterday Emmet McGovern, Aaron West and I sat down with Ray Camden for lunch. A great guy, who\'s very laid back and easy to talk to, he is also very open to suggestions on the apps he\'s put out. He and Emmet got to know each other well about a year back when Emmet had a rather large Soundings implementation that was having issues. A company was running a 73 question survey that had 500,000 entries in four days. They went to run the Excel reports and Ray had to come in and save the day (you may remember the week or so of Soundings updates back then...) Great guy, easy to talk to, and immensely helpful to our community as a whole.\r\n\r\nAnyway, there will be lots more to come as I begin to break down everything I\'ve taken in over the last few days, but for now I\'ll sign off and try to pay attention to this CFAJAX session.','2006-06-30 13:38:00',NULL,'Day-3','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2753,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 ('43A7FD30-3048-71C2-1772DEC2B6D66973','CFUnited Wrap Up Pt 1: CFEclipse','Well, I downloaded the <a href=\"http://www.cfeclipse.org\" target=\"_blank\">CFEclipse</a> beta plugin, and installed it into a fresh install of <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse</a> 3.2. I opened my workbench, set up a project, opened my perspective and everything broke. CFEclipse has always been a great tool, but this beta is way too early, and should probably be scrapped to start over.\r\n\r\nOK, jokes over. <a href=\"http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Drew</a> will quietly chuckle at this post, the last time I\'ll bring up this now old joke from the conference. The fact is, CFEclipse is the new phenom. Everybody loves it. Everybody was talking about it. <strong>Every</strong> session showing code examples was using it. And everyone from <a href=\"http://www.forta.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Forta</a> to <a href=\"http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm?\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Corfield</a> to <a href=\"http://www.clearsoftware.net\" target=\"_blank\">Joe Rinehart</a> (etc., etc....) was telling us \"If you\'re not using it you should be\".\r\n\r\nThose of you who\'ve been following this blog know that we spent quite a bit of time with Mark while in Bethesda. Aside for consuming fairly large amounts of alcohol, we also had the opportunity to give Mark some feedback on CFEclipse features, for which he was furiously taking notes for later updates. In Mark\'s (paraphrased) words, \"This is great. I spend so much time working on CFEclipse (in Java) that sometimes I lose site of what features might be necessary from a (CF) development standpoint.\"\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, downloads of CFEclipse saw a sharp increase during and after the conference. In a small bit of irony, during the Flex sessions the presenters kept saying \"use CFEclipse\" for CFC editing, yet Flex 2.0 does not yet work on Eclipse 3.2 (several key features break, including the RDS support), yet the beta (\"Beeta\", as Mark would say) only works on Eclipse 3.2. I asked <a href=\"http://www.mikenimer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Nimer</a> about this during the Flex and ColdFusion Integration session, at which point he stated that an update to Flex would be \"a priority.\" (Side Note: the Eclipse Callisto release, an update to 3.2 for the IDE, as well as several key related projects, came out two days after Ben\'s keynote announcement about the release of Flex 2.0)\r\n\r\nThe good news? For those who care to do so, Eclipse runs standalone, so you could run 3.1, with the current stable version of CFEclipse, if you wish to do Flex development, while also running 3.2 with the CFEclipse beta for straight CF development.\r\n\r\nSome features of the beta? Language versioning per project for tag insight and code complete (courtesy of funding from <a href=\"http://www.newatlanta.com\" target=\"_blank\">NewAtlanta</a>), Word Wrap (yeah!), and CF dev toolbars similar to those of Dreamweaver or Homesite (for those of you who like that sort of thing).\r\n\r\nAnd, straight from the CFEclipse session, the one really cool feature that\'s been there that most never knew about? The scibble pad. Look it up, you won\'t regret it.','2006-07-06 06:43:00',NULL,'CFUnited-Wrap-Up-Pt-1-CFEclipse','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',3966,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It\'s just me, but coding consistency is important. It makes code easier to read, follow, and maintain. So why is it that, in certain places, a cfset tag will have the xml closing style, while in others it will not:\r\n<code>\r\n<cfset var foo = 0 />\r\n<cfset var foo = \"this one\">\r\n</code>\r\nThis is all over the place in the generated code, even in the same template (or function block). There are even inconsistencies in the code indentation (another necessary thing for code readability).<br />\r\n<li>Odd Wizard Output<li>\r\nLike the drop down that let\'s you select \'public\' or \'private\' for your \'Property scope:\' Let me tell you what I expected and what I received. I thought that, in selecting \'private\', all of my setter methods within the Bean would have an access type of \'private\'. But that didn\'t happen. In fact, I don\'t think it affected anything at all (as all of the methods are \'public\' on generation.)<br />\r\n<li>Odd Code</li>\r\nI know that a team of developers probably built these extensions, but who would have thought that they could all be so different? For instance, why does the Bean have an init() method, while both the DAO and Gateway objects do not? \"Well, Cutter, maybe it\'s because the DAO and Gateway don\'t have any properties?\" No, that can\'t be it. The DAO and the Gateway objects both have database calls, so they must have a property for the datasource name, right?...Hey, why is there a DSN hardcoded in to the cfquery statements? Doesn\'t make for a very portable object, does it?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Within the DAO objects: In the read() method, why doesn\'t it just loop the returned query\'s columns with \'set\' statements, rather than writing each one out line by line? Wrap it in a try/catch, with an empty catch, and it\'ll skip any column that doesn\'t have a matching setter method without causing a hard error or interrupting the flow (There does appear to be a good reason for not doing this, but that\'s another item you\'ll see below.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And what about that create() method? Pass in a bean object, set variables with the value of the \'get\' method of each property, and then pass the variables themselves in to the cfqueryparam value attributes (having the server evaluate that variable in the process [not to be confused with evaluate()] Why waste the steps?:\r\n<code>\r\n<cfqueryparam cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_varchar\" value=\"#arguments.bean.getFirstName()#\" />\r\n</code>\r\nThe funny thing is, that is how it\'s done in the update() method.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why do I get \'null=[bunchastuff]\' on cfqueryparam tags of table columns that don\'t allow nulls? I don\'t get that? The Wizard is already reading the table\'s metadata to give us the column name and data type, it can\'t get whether it\'s required?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And why do I have to pass in a Bean object to my delete() method? All it needs is the ID and it\'s all set, why waste the memory to allocate for a whole object?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then we get to the Gateway. Here\'s a \'GetAll()\' method, that returns the ID of all records from the table and loops through the recordset to create a bean object instance for each record, placing the beans in an array. Whoa Baby! What\'s up if you have several thousand records in that table? \"Hey man? Why\'d my RAM utilization just go through the roof?\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>OK, so maybe I\'m bitchin\' too much.</strong> Or, maybe, these a several small points. Why doesn\'t the the read() method in the DAO loop the columns and dynamically create/fill the new bean? Because the data validation is directly in the set() methods of the Bean. Now, I would put these things in a validate() method of the Bean, which is always called prior to the \'save()\' method of the Gateway, but that\'s my preference. Just like I would rather pass a struct (like the \'form\' scope) into my create and update methods, rather than an actual Bean object. A matter of preference.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if my Java skills were greater, and you could decompile a .jar and .class files (Which I don\'t think you can, last I checked, but Mark will set me straight I\'m sure), then I\'d try to make the changes myself. But, that\'s not possible, so I guess I\'ll forward this post on to <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> for a possible update (as soon as I figure out who to send it to). It would be nice if there were some sort of XML file one could change, in order to create our own preferential style of code, but that\'s probably asking for too much. Maybe a consensus on developer\'s views of several \"Best Practice\" implementations? Or maybe Adobe should just give the current code to <a href=\"http://www.markdrew.co.uk/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Mark Drew</a>, pay him some dough (<strong>that\'ll get him to <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/events/max/\" target=\"_blank\">MAX</a>, an expensive trip for him when he doesn\'t get paid for continuing development on the tool we use everyday</strong>), and have him find out what we\'d like and code it? (<span style=\"color:red;\">Side caveat: I am not saying that Mark would. I\'m not his booking agent, nor his headhunter, nor him, so I\'m just offering that as a possible solution for Adobe to consider. I would not expect Mark to work on any feature of CFEclipse that he hasn\'t put on the radar himself as an item of priority [and I know he\'s got some really cool stuff on that radar], or if he were getting paid to do so [which would only benefit us in the end as well].</span>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>(He\'s gonna kill me now...)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;;)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But, overall, it\'s a great first step. When I ran it through the paces this weekend, using the Wizard on only nine tables in less than 5 minutes saved me hours and hours of tedious, repititious coding. Sure, I had to tweak it a lot, but it still cut my workload by more than at least two thirds by doing these common tasks for me. And, unlike Reactor, I can see all of the code the wizard generated for me and adjust it directly to my needs (run an MS SQL timestamp field by Reactor and see what it does for you). I can now take my CFCs and plug them in to a <a href=\"http://model-glue.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Model-Glue</a> app, a <a href=\"http://mach-ii.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mach-II</a> app, a <a href=\"http://www.fusebox.org\" target=\"_blank\">Fusebox</a> app, or just roll them in to <a href=\"http://corfield.org/blog/index.cfm/do/blog.entry/entry/Simonology\" target=\"_blank\">my own architecture</a> (Hey, where did that link go to?) if I wished.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What do you folks think?

 ('6D91220A-3048-71C2-1706A2EFBDC02A37','ColdFusion Mail Spool Lock','<p>Recently I\'ve seen posts on both the <a href=\"http://houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">CF-Talk</a> list at <a href=\"http://www.houseoffusion.com\" target=\"_blank\">House of Fusion</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/index.cfm?forumid=1\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe ColdFusion Forum</a> about a lock on the CF Mail Spool. At some point messages in the spool recycle over and over, without processing out to the mail server or going in to the undelivered folder.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was working for a small regional internet service provider when I began working as a ColdFusion developer. We hosted around six hundred corporate sites, most of which used the &lt;cfmail&gt; tag in some form of form processing or another. This was back in the days of ColdFusion 4.0, and was when I first encountered this issue, and I\'ve seen it several times since.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically what happens is the ColdFusion server loses it\'s connection to the mail server momentarily. Typically you\'ll see an error in your ColdFusion mail.log file that will state that the connection to your mail server failed at some point. When this happens there is a file lock on a .cfmail file in the spool that was being processed at the time the failure occurred. The connection comes back, but the file lock seems to cause a continual loop on the spool, which disallows the flow of files from the spool to the mail server. It often goes unnoticed until a client calls in to complain that they haven\'t recieved any leads from their site.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The issue is really easy to get around, but does require you to take down ColdFusion services for a moment so that the file lock is released. Here is a general outline of what you should do.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n     <li>Stop ColdFusion services</li>\r\n     <li>Cut and paste all .cfmail files from the spool folder into a temporary folder.</li>\r\n     <li>Restart ColdFusion services</li>\r\n     <li>Verify the mail server connection in the ColdFusion Administrator</li>\r\n     <li>Drag .cfmail files from the temp folder back into the spool folder at about 200 messages at a time, waiting for all messages to process out of the spool before moving to the next batch.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>That\'s it. Pretty easy to handle. Your greatest hurdle is convincing a shared hosting provider that this needs to be done, but if they watch the spool folder and notice the same messages re-enter the spool repeatedly, without dropping to the undelivered folder, then it is a solid indicator that this is what has occured. All files leave the spool and show up five, ten, even fifteen minutes later. I have now worked for two separate hosting companies running everything from ColdFusion 4 through 7, and have seen it occur on each version at one time or another. Hope this helps someone!</p>','2006-12-10 12:33:00',NULL,'ColdFusion-Mail-Spool-Lock','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',8099,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

One of the nicest updates I\'ve seen is the liquid layouts. I replaced the <a href=\"http://www.alagad.com\" target=\"_blank\">Alagad</a> image component with <a href=\"http://www.efflare.com\" target=\"_blank\">Efflare</a>\'s imagecr3 tag. After extensive testing, I (and my colleagues) have found that the java imageio based tags were just not stable enough, nor was the conversion quality up to par. After looking through our (3,000+ templates) codebase, I wrote a new image.cfc wrapper for the imagecr3 tag, writing functions with names that matched those we were using within the Alagad component. Although the update to our three production servers definitely outlined our need for version control, overall the replacement of the image.cfc worked like a charm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stay tuned. I\'m hoping, this week, to post another installment to my tutorial on \"the View\", where I\'ll begin to get in to making the templates dynamic. We might also talk about the use of &lt;cfinclude&gt; inside of CFCs and UDFs (some things to be aware of).</p>','2006-08-08 07:17:00',NULL,'Still-Here','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1094,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It\'s been a little while, so you may want to go back and review parts 1, 2 and 3 before continuing. At this point we\'ve created a very basic structure, giving you a basic, standards compliant document and stylesheet. But, <strong style=\"font-style:italic;\">you still don\'t really have any content</strong>, just a header with a bogus title, a spot for a menu, and a container for content and a sidebar. Where to next?</p>','2006-08-14 05:55:00','<p>Well, that\'s part of the beauty of ColdFusion, and even web development as a whole. There is no one right way of doing things. Sure, you should try to keep your documents as standards compliant as possible, but now we are getting down to the meat of it all, dynamic documents. This is where we get in to the server side of things; variables and databases and frameworks (<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cutterscrossi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%3F%26index=dvd%26keywords=B000ADS64E%26_encoding=UTF8\" target=\"_blank\">oh my!</a>) The exact same thing can sometimes be done any number of ways, which is part of what I intend to show you over the next several posts to this tutorial.</p>\r\n<p>First things first, how far should you go? Just how much of your document should be dynamic? Well, there are several different answers here, but I\'m going to give you my opinion on it. Most of it. \"Huh?\" some of you are now saying. You heard me right, most of it. People come back to sites that change, and often. This is part of why blogs are so popular now, they are in continual states of flux, constantly sharing old and new thoughts and ideas.</p>\r\n<p>But, I\'m getting away from our primary mission here. Layout. Layouts, themselves, are generally the same. They are meant to be. Consistency of design throughout a site is almost as important as the content itself. A consistent design means that the user always knows how to navigate through the site, because they always know exactly where the navigation is. The logo for the site/company/entity is always in the same place, maintaining identity (also known as branding). If you look at some of the most popular sites on the internet over the past decade (<a href=\"http://www.yahoo.com\" target=\"_blank\">Yahoo</a>, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ebay.com\" target=\"_blank\">EBay</a>, <a href=\"http://www.google.com\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>,...) you\'ll notice that their basic interfaces really haven\'t changed much. Sure, the gears behind the scenes have been upgraded several times, and their core functionality has been repeatedly extended, but their basic design hasn\'t really changed much. Why is that? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brand\" target=\"_blank\">Branding</a>. That \'look\' has become just as much of their identity as their logos have. People know that, when they visit one of these sites they can almost always find what they are looking for. Their designs facilitate that fluidity of movement, because they rarely change.</p>\r\n<p>So we come back to our document. We take those core elements, headers, menus, sidebars, footers, and turn them in to server side includes. Pieces that can be dropped on to every dynamic document (like a ColdFusion .cfm file) within a site, so that it maintains it\'s consistency. This could be done as an include, a set of <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/server_archive/articles/cf_adv_custom_tag_syntax.html\" target=\"_blank\">custom tags</a>, a <a href=\"http://www.fusebox.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=fusebox.faq#gq5\" target=\"_blank\">fuseaction</a>, a piece of an \'event\'. The choice of how it is implemented is up to you, the developer.</p>\r\n<p>Oh, I forgot to mention something when we began today. This post doesn\'t have any code. I want you to flex your brain a little first. We need to place some dynamic variables within our base document. Things that will change from page to page, like the title for instance. What other elements of the base template might be candidates for dynamic variables? And what scopes might those variables reside within? Remember that we\'re not talking about the core content of the page, but rather the elements that make up to consistent design elements of your site. In the next lesson in this tutorial, I\'ll outline a few suggestions I have for this, as well as going over some of what you might share in your comments here.</p>','Making-The-View-Part-4','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2612,1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

You start to work in a certain environment for so long that you take on bad habits by example of the work you are associated with. Trouble, with a capital \'T\'.\r\n\r\nCase in point. I was contracted out for a very small job, a friend of my company\'s Technology Director wanted to put a football pool on his website. Very straight forward, even for a guy like me who has little to no interest in sports. He sent in a hand drawn diagram of what he wanted each screen to look like, and exact instructions on the function of each page.\r\n\r\nEasy. Simple. No brainer. So, I quoted him 4 hours of work. I wrote it in <a href=\"http://www.model-glue.com\" target=\"_blank\">Model-Glue: Unity</a> to play and learn, knocked it out over 2 days in about 8 hours (giving for learning curve), and had it fully functional on my server for testing. It worked great, and the client was getting a little more than he asked for in the process.\r\n\r\nBut then you have to deploy to production. Client\'s server environment. And this client was with a shared hosting facility. After three hours, and countless phone calls, they finally had all of the cf mappings set up correctly. This was necessary, since their site was not the webroot. I hit the page, and <strong>BAM!</strong>, error. My flawless little app was not functioning as intended, at all.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it might have something to do with folder and file permissions. No dice. I was seeking advice left and right. Finally I asked <a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Camden</a> for his thoughts, and he says \"Look at case sensitivity.\"\r\n\r\nWell, it was a Linux server. But, the majority of the pathing code was written by Model-Glue, so I was a little stumped.\r\n\r\nAnd then I really looked at the messages. My version of <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a> was .01 version off of the host\'s, and mine was on <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windows/\" target=\"_blank\">Windows</a>. Then I saw it in their online MySQL administrator, multicase table names.\r\n\r\nWith my version of MySQL, all table names are lower case, but queries can reference them without case sensitivity. In their version of MySQL, case sensitivity is queen (and a bitch at that), and can cause you great heartache.\r\n\r\nYou see, Model-Glue and <a href=\"http://livedocs.reactorframework.org\" target=\"_blank\">Reactor</a> autogenerate many files from your scaffolds and the Reactor.xml file, and use the same case sensitivity as that of your scaffolds and object setups. I had to recompile the site, page by page, with an adjusted config files, and then re-customize my display templates, plus rename a few thing within my Controller.cfc file.\r\n\r\nSo, in hind sight, I probably could have just changed the table names to the same case sensitivity as I had used in my files, but I just adjusted all of the files anyway. My overall point is this, always watch your case sensitivity. You may know, from the beginning, where and on what your application will be deployed, but what happens if your client decides to switch hosts the following year? Nightmare, with only yourself to blame. Be case sensitive to everything: paths, db tables and column names, CFC methods and arguments. Everything. You will save yourself a lot of trouble in the long run.','2006-09-01 14:42:00',NULL,'Development-Lessons-Learned','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1588,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

A slightly more powerful machine that a friend of mine was going to put on <a href=\"http://www.freecycle.org\" target=\"_blank\">FreeCycle</a> (Thanks Patti!), I thought it was perfect to go ahead and make some changes to my dev environment. I want to begin using <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Subversion</a>, plus I figured I would go ahead and switch to CF on top of <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a> (since IIS Sucks!), not to mention setting up CF on the multiserver install. Hey, why not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.stephencollins.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Stephen Collins</a> has a fine document called the <a href=\"http://www.acidlabs.org/extras/acme/\" target=\"_blank\">ACME guide</a> (for the uninitiated) that thoroughly covers setting up a basic, free development environment: <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a>, <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mysql.org\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a>, (<a href=\"http://www.cfeclipse.org\" target=\"_blank\">CF</a>)<a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org\" target=\"_blank\">Eclipse</a>. I thought this would be a good place to start, but didn\'t realize that Apache had upgraded their server before <a href=\"http://blog.acidlabs.org/\" target=\"_blank\">AcidLabs</a> could update the ACME guide. Whoops! ColdFusion install completes but Apache won\'t restart!</p>','2007-01-16 22:33:00','<p>After banging my head on the wall for a short time I finally just gave up and decided to ask all of the other fine, smart folks on the <a href=\"http://houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">CF-Talk</a> mailing list. A nice guy, by the name of Adrian Moreno, passed along a little <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/go/8001e97\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe TechNote</a> about an update to the wsconfig.jar, where to download it and how to configure it. He also pointed to me to a line to uncomment in the httpd.conf file:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# Virtual hosts\r\n#Include conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>So, step 1: install new .jar file to the proper server location. Step 2: go to the command line to \'install\' the new connector. Step 3: restart ColdFusion and Apache.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, so everything should be good. But, wait. What\'s this? It still won\'t start! OK, so I go to the Web Server Configuration Tool (that java GUI util), remove the Apache instance, and \'add\' a new instance. Yeah! Services up!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kinda.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, I have services up and running, but now I can\'t figure out how to get to my CF Admin. In fact, I couldn\'t even find the CFIDE folder. Then I remember the setup instructions in the ACME guide and a little path to an \'htdocs\' folder in the Apache folder. OK, it\'s a start. I also remember the server name I set up when installing Apache. Go to \'http://my.server.name/CFIDE/Administrator\', hit enter....access denied.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now I am truly loving my new server. You have no idea how much joy and laughter and tears are had in Cutter\'s Crib. And yet, we continue (now on day 3). Finally, after some Googling and such, looking in to access and permissions, and perusing various .conf files I finally find it. When enabling virtual hosts (through that httpd_vhosts thing above) I did not (nor did I realize I needed to) add the host I had originally setup in the Apache install: http://my.server.name/</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Man this is fun! Like a dentist appointment! Now I have my CF Admin again. I\'ve also switched MySQL versions, changed MySQL administrator GUI, and I haven\'t even begun to deploy my copies of code.

 ('A49DA156-3048-71C2-17DBFF5159EFFE8D','Beginner SQL Tricks: NULL Value Defaults','<p>OK, I\'m not a beginner with SQL. After 7 years of hammering away at web apps I\'ve picked up a little bit here and there. But I also try to remember how difficult it was for me to wrap my head around certain things that didn\'t necessarily have to do with programming logic. Things like design, layout, and database calls.</p>','2007-02-08 21:51:00','<p>Yesterday I was working on an old template at work. It was a self posting add/edit form, with case statements in the beginning to determine what particular form action was to be taken. This particular form handled user administration and administrative access privileges within the same form, tying admin users to ticket groups within our ticketing system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, here\'s the scenario for you. You have a table of user data, within which certain users are marked as admin users. You have another table that maps admin users to ticket groups (administration, sales, support, etc.) Knowing this you might assume that a query to fill the form might look something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfquery name=\"VARIABLES.GetAdminUsers\" datasource=\"#APPLICATION.myDSN#\">\r\n     SELECT     U.intUserID,\r\n                U.vcFirstName,\r\n                U.vcLastName,\r\n                mUTG.bIsTicketQueueManager,\r\n                mUTG.bIsGroupManager\r\n     FROM       Users U\r\n     INNER JOIN mapUsersTicketGroups mUTG ON U.intUserID = mUTG.fkUsers\r\n     WHERE      U.bIsAdministrator = 1\r\n</cfquery>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>That seems fairly straight forward, right? OK, let\'s throw a kink into it. Lets say that users (even admin users) might not be assigned to a ticket group. The above query would only return users that are part of a ticket group, so we have to adjust our query to bring in all admin users. We do this by changing our JOIN type:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfquery name=\"VARIABLES.GetAdminUsers\" datasource=\"#APPLICATION.myDSN#\">\r\n     SELECT     U.intUserID,\r\n                U.vcFirstName,\r\n                U.vcLastName,\r\n                mUTG.bIsTicketQueueManager,\r\n                mUTG.bIsGroupManager\r\n     FROM       Users U\r\n     LEFT JOIN mapUsersTicketGroups mUTG ON U.intUserID = mUTG.fkUsers\r\n     WHERE      U.bIsAdministrator = 1\r\n</cfquery>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we\'re getting somewhere. A record is returned for each admin user, regardless of whether they have been assigned to a ticket group. But this is where it gets trickier still. Remember, you have a form that is populated by this query. All of the columns related to ticket group information for users who are unassigned to a ticket group will return a NULL value. This is important because ColdFusion converts database NULLs to an empty string the first time they are referenced as a simple value:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"bIsTicketQueueManager\" id=\"bIsTicketQueueManager\"<cfif VARIABLES.GetAdminUsers.bIsTicketQueueManager> checked=\"checked\"</cfif> value=\"1\" />\r\n<input type=\"checkbox\" name=\"bIsGroupManager\" id=\"bIsGroupManager\"<cfif VARIABLES.GetAdminUsers.bIsGroupManager> checked=\"checked\"</cfif> value=\"1\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>On records containing NULLs, the above code would throw an error, because \"\" can not be cast to a boolean value. If only we could set a default value for fields that might return NULL? You could write some conditional statements after your query to set values, but that gets clunky and places the burden on your ColdFusion server processes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily most SQL servers (except MS Access, but it doesn\'t count) have built in functions to handle just this type of task directly at the server level. With MS SQL server you would use the <em><a href=\"http://www.sqlteam.com/item.asp?ItemID=510\" target=\"_blank\">ISNULL(expr1,expr2)</a></em> method. MySQL uses the similar <em><a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/comparison-operators.html\" target=\"_blank\">IFNULL(expr1,expr2)</a></em> method, while within PostgreSQL you can apparently do this with the <em><a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org/docs/8.1/interactive/functions-conditional.html\" target=\"_blank\">COALESCE(expr1,expr2)</a></em> method. All of these work in the same basic way, evaluating expression one and, if NULL, applying expression two (there are slight differences, see links for documentation [p.s. Read documentation comments too]). So, to fix our earlier query we could do something like this:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfquery name=\"VARIABLES.GetAdminUsers\" datasource=\"#APPLICATION.myDSN#\">\r\n     SELECT     U.intUserID,\r\n                U.vcFirstName,\r\n                U.vcLastName,\r\n                ISNULL(mUTG.bIsTicketQueueManager,0) AS bIsTicketQueueManager,\r\n                ISNULL(mUTG.bIsGroupManager,0) AS bIsGroupManager\r\n     FROM       Users U\r\n     LEFT JOIN mapUsersTicketGroups mUTG ON U.intUserID = mUTG.fkUsers\r\n     WHERE      U.bIsAdministrator = 1\r\n</cfquery>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>Wonderful little trick to use, relatively simple, and can be used in many different ways. Default date values, booleans, foriegn key id\'s, whatever you might need. Took me a few years to find this (didn\'t know what I was looking for), so I hope it helps somebody.</p>','Beginner-SQL-Tricks-NULL-Value-Defaults','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',7515,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

He has put together support for several different database platforms, including MS SQL, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Access (OK, we razzed him a little on this last one.) All in all some very nice functionality, but it\'s not a replacement for ORM. I personally can\'t see using DataMgr, myself, for anything more than a small application/site, but I did see some huge benefits within initial development, or within some non-framework Open Source projects (<a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray\'s</a> <a href=\"http://www.blogcfc.com\" target=\"_blank\">BlogCFC</a> project kept coming up in conversation around the room.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably one of the coolest things about DataMgr went a little like this: Design your db structure within Access, with the help of the relationships map, verify how data looks using some QuerySim/prototyping like functions, have DataMgr create an xml descriptor of your database tables, then deploy your app to a new server. Change the database type (say, to MySQL) in your DataMgr initialization call and watch your table structure be built or modified in your new datasource. If a table already exists, but you have added new fields, then DataMgr will create the new fields for you without messing with your other data (will not delete existing columns if you forgot to put them in the XML).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, so this is a quick-down-and-dirty idea of what DataMgr can do. Steve\'s presentation is much more digestable, and his examples are very clean and clear cut. We made one or two suggestions to him along the way, to which his response was \"That sounds like a great idea, I\'ll put it in tomorrow.\" He also has a few other goodies available <a href=\"http://www.sebtools.com\" target=\"_blank\">on his site</a>.

Everything in the directory tree below those directories (subdirectories \r\nand all) is now available through the virtual directory mappings. So if I want to try:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfimport prefix=\"ui\" taglib=\"/myotherstuff/CustomTags/ui\">\r\n<ui:incThis>\r\n</code>\r\nI can call the incThis.cfm file from <strong>&quot;\\\\Remote\\Networked\\Computer\\directory\\CustomTags\\ui&quot;</strong>\r\n</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, that&rsquo;s it for today.

But some were still undecided about independence.</p>','2006-07-04 13:16:00','<p>Such was the scene in the Second Continental Congress, the political stage unto which Jefferson stepped in 1776. The thirty-two year old lawyer, writer, and statesman had been chosen to take the place of his elder cousin, Peyton Randolph. Young Jefferson was to sit in council with the top political thinkers of his time (Ben Franklin, John Hancock, and John Adams to name a few) to bring the colonies into a new direction, freedom and independence of Britain\'s rule. The revolution had begun in earnest with with Lexington and Concord.  Now there was a Continental Army, commanded by General George Washington.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>Thomas Jefferson was the most complex of simple men. Born into a wealthy family he was still raised with deep seated morals taught to him at the school of the Reverend Matthew Maury (who educated three of our nations presidents, Jefferson, James Madison, and James Monroe). After his initial education Thomas Jefferson attended the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Virginia. After two years there he went to work in the law office of George Wythe, one of the most distinguished lawyers of the day and a signer of the Declaration of Independence. Even at this age Jefferson was recognized for his brilliance, by both his peers and his mentors.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>In 1770 Jefferson began public service as county lieutenant of Albemarle County. In 1773 he became county surveyor, and a year later he was chosen for the Virginia Convention which would become the state legislature. Unable to attend due to illness, he nevertheless sent his position on to the other members of the convention. This position was anonymously published by some of his friends as a <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cutterscrossi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%3F%26index=books%26keywords=B000ELABP4%26_encoding=UTF8\" class=\"book\">Summary View of the Rights of British Americans</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n	<blockquote>\"Kings, he informed George III (in an age when kings were approached with reverence), are the servants, not the proprietors of the people. \'Open your breast, Sire, to liberal and expanded thought.

He was a very shy, soft-spoken man, and when he spoke publicly (a truly rare occasion) it was always very clear, thought out, and to the point. He said more of meaning in a few sentences than many of today\'s congressmen speak in their entire term of office. When it was clear that the colonies were in revolution, it was Jefferson who was asked to round out the committee to write the <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Declaration for the Causes and Necessity for Taking Up Arms</span> to be read by General Washington to his troops, to justify the actions which were being taken towards war.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>To explain all of the events which led up to the signing of the Declaration of Independence would take up chapters. A committee of five (Ben Franklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, Robert R. Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson) was appointed by the Continental Congress to draft the formal Declaration of Independence. All of these men were distinguished, but it was young Jefferson who received the highest vote, of any of the five, to not only be on but head the committee.</p>\r\n\r\n	<blockquote>\"He had already won for himself a reputation for his \'masterly pen\' and for his \'peculiar felicity of expression.\' \"(<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cutterscrossi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%3F%26index=books%26keywords=0689815239%26_encoding=UTF8\" class=\"book\">Great Achievers: Thomas Jefferson-Man on a Mountain</a>, Natalie S. Bober, Collier Books, 1993, quotes by John Adams)</blockquote>\r\n\r\n	<p>It was unanimously decided by the other members of the committee that Thomas Jefferson should actually write the document. He was known throughout the colonies as one of the most elegant and prolific writers of that time. For seventeen days Jefferson secluded himself in the home of a brickmason on the outskirts of Philadelphia and, without books or notes but only his encyclopedic memory, wrote his initial draft of the Declaration of Independence. After he had finished, he sent the draft to John Adams, and in turn Ben Franklin to find their reaction. After a few minor changes, the document was sent on to the other members of the committee for their input and received unqualified approval (It is interesting to note that Robert Livingston, a conservative who was against breaking off from Britain, had been asked to join this committee and had left Philadelphia in order to not have to give his opinion of the declaration [<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cutterscrossi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%3F%26index=books%26keywords=039506581X%26_encoding=UTF8\" class=\"book\">Signers of the Declaration</a>, Katherine and John Bakeless, Houghton Mifflin Company, 1969]). The time had come to bring the document before congress.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>On Friday, June 28, the document was brought before congress and tabled until the following Monday. That Monday as the session began, the argument was finally begun as to whether to actually declare independence. On Tuesday, July2, congress made the most momentous decision of American history, A decision that, should it fail, would mean trial and death for treason for every member of congress. Independence from British rule.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>John Adams, writing to his wife the next day, said:\r\n	<blockquote>\"Yesterday, the greatest question was decided, which ever was debated in America, and a greater, perhaps, never was nor will be decided among men....The second day of July, 1776, will be the most memorable epoch in the history of America. I am apt to believe that it will be celebrated by succeeding generations as the great anniversary festival. It out to be commemorated, as the day of deliverance, by solemn acts of devotion to God Almighty. It ought to be solemnized with pomp and parade.....\"(<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?link_code=ur2&tag=cutterscrossi-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&location=/gp/search%3F%26index=books%26keywords=0932051154%26_encoding=UTF8\" class=\"book\">Works</a>, John Adams)</blockquote></p>\r\n\r\n	<p>But the 4th of July became a much more momentous occasion. After much heated debate over wording, and even the removal of several key points (such as Jefferson\'s paragraph condemning slavery), the Declaration of Independence was accepted by congress and signed by John Hancock, President of the Continental Congress. The Congressional Secretary, Charles Thomson witnessed it. The deed was done, and the most influential document ever written in American history was accepted. The document declared the United Colonies to be Free and Independent States.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>There are volumes of information on the life and history of Thomas Jefferson. They will tell you of the hardships he had dealt with during these trying times. Mr. Jefferson had six children, only two of whom lived. His mother died in 1776, and in 1782 his beloved wife, Martha, also died. Although he was essentially a very wealthy man, public service did not pay as much as it cost, and the crops grown at his estate, Monticello, suffered more and more during his absences. And his public service extended to terms as first War Governor of Virginia, America\'s first Secretary of State (as a side note it was Jefferson\'s proposal to accept the dollar, based upon the decimal system, as our currency, instead of the pound or the franc), Ambassador to France, and vice-president and President of the United States. He also designed and had built the University of Virginia, and assembled what would eventually evolve into the Library of Congress.</p>\r\n\r\n	<p>The information given here is only a portion of the events revolving around the Declaration of Independence and the life of Thomas Jefferson.

And, in my mind, this World Wide Web thing was gonna take off. I quickly got tired of perusing online porn day-in and day-out, IRC was boring, and people were really starting to try to make money. This new online bookstore of the day, <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.com</a>, was really taking off in sales, even though they still weren\'t turning a profit.</p>','2006-07-08 01:24:00','<p>I was really starting to get turned off to Army life. Sitting in a job I really didn\'t enjoy, pouring over and analyzing tons of meaningless data day-to-day, bouncing around hither-and-yon, was really starting to affect my attitude. My one concession was studying HTML on my job\'s intranet, creating an internal website for our unit\'s Better Opportunities for Single Servicemembers Program. Then, while out singing one night, I met the nephew of a local bar owner. He and his brother owned and ran a small screen printing company on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, just outside of Ocean City. Heavy into providing marketing solutions for corporations, he saw the value of the growing internet, and wanted someone on board with the technical background to help their company to the next level.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>At this point I knew I wasn\'t staying in the Army. I had already turned down advancement twice, feeling that those slots were better served by some other soldier who was planning on staying in for a while, and riding out the rest of my term. So when Al asked me to join the company when I got out of the Army, giving me an ownership stake, I jumped at it. I filled out my paperwork for an early out, left it on the counter of my apartment, and walked in to work to get an email. \"You have been temporarily reassigned for a three month tour in the United Arab Emerites....\" There was no way out of it. I was on my way to Saudi Arabia.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>While I was in Riyadh a lot happened. A bomb went off in Dahran, three days after I had been there. My girlfriend left me to play the field (Her apartment burned to the ground shortly after that. Very ironic.) The Olympics began, and a pipe bomb went off at a celebration. My Grandfather had a stroke. I wasn\'t having a fun time. Luckily, it didn\'t last very long. I got back, out processed, and headed for the Eastern Shore.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p><a href=\"http://www.mcgraphixinc.com\" target=\"_blank\">McGRAPHIX</a> became a four man shop. There was Al, the marketing guru formerly of Wall Street and IBM. Steve was an old Cobol and Fortran developer, who had helped his father (Big Al) pump the presses when the shop began. And then there was Frank, an outstanding graphic artist who could work magic with a pen, and just as much with Corel Draw (and you should see some of the stuff he started doing when he discovered Illustrator and Photoshop). I had developed a quick (and ugly) site for them before I had left for Saudi, which helped them get a technology grant from the state of Deleware. I had become pretty good with HTML, had picked up some JavaScript, and then screwed up and started working in FrontPage (oh, the shame!) Now I was ready to get down to work, and I did. They quickly put a squeegy in my hands and started teaching me the fine art of screen printing. I did it all, from sales calls to making or cleaning screens, to printing t-shirts and bumper stickers. I was dirt poor, with no family nearby, working 60 - 80 hours a week for my piece of the company pie. We slaved all year long for low profit margins, but slowly built business to three times the size of when I started. Steve and I set up internal email, created profiles and shared contact lists in Outlook, and built up the internal peer-to-peer network. I created systems automation processes using Word forms, Outlook custom templates, and Excel spreadsheets. Frank and I built a much better looking website, with him overseeing the \'corporate image\', and me putting the pieces together. I had become a wizard of FrontPage, while occasionally getting in under the hood with some custom JavaScript (as long as FrontPage would let me.)</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>I got a hold of some old military contacts and put together e-mail and mailer campaigns to the marketing offices (and BOSS Councils) of every Army, Navy and Marine station in the world. Started placing calls monthly to each stateside office that would take my calls, and slowly began to build a strong following of military clientele. The company was growing, but I was still dirt poor, and I hated it. I just wanted to program, not push a squeegy. The guys finally decided that they needed a salesman more than an IT guy, and let me go.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>So, I worked on cars. That afternoon, after being laid off, I went over to a buddy\'s garage and he put me to work. I was changing oil and fixing flats and sweeping up the shop everyday while sending out resumes and answering want ads. At night I started tending bar at a place run by some other friends of mine, where my girlfriend also worked as a Karaoke hostess. You can make mad tips when you sing and pour drinks at the same time. I was looking for a web related job in an area that was fairly technologically backwards, but I wasn\'t giving up.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Finally, I interviewed forTechnical Support position with <a href=\"http://www.dmv.com\" target=\"_blank\">Delmarva Online</a>, a regional Internet Service Provider. Rick Caceres, the support manager, was a former military guy himself, who saw my credentials and potential and offered me the job. He knew that I would work my way up, and out of his department, in short order, but he also thought I could be a positive force within the company. I was finally back to the web!</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Technical Support requires an interesting mix of skills. My technical background gave me the knowledge to work easily with the questions that came up on the phone. My prior experience with sales gave me the competency and tact to handle calls with clients, who usually only called when they were frustrated or angry. And my military background gave me the patience to walk hundreds of 70+ year old retirees in setting up their connection manually through the Microsoft dialer. When calls were light, I started catching up. The web had grown up, and I was behind. HTML 4.0 was the new specification, CSS was taking over the font tag, DHTML was all the rage, and the dotcom boom had fizzled to dust. I created online manuals for the tech support team, with step by step, javascript interactive screenshots for setting up connections, configuring 3 different versions of 3 different browsers and email programs. We later migrated these same files to the support section of our corporate site, fleshing out our online FAQ. Now, I was looking for more.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p><strong>OK, enough for now.</strong> Next time out I\'ll go into how I got into ColdFusion.</p>','The-History-of-Cutter-and-Computers-Part-3','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1949,1,0,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Oh yeah, one last (important) thing. Tags and attributes in an XHTML document are always lower case.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK class, that\'s a little background on what little we have so far. Let\'s get on to the meat and potatoes of this tutorial. Style!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cascading Style Sheets have been around for some time now. The concept is simple, separate style from content. This is great, because, by defining a global style sheet for a site, every page can maintain the same basic look and feel. From a marketing and branding perspective this is extremely important, but even more so from a usability stand point. A consistency of design makes it easier on your users when navigating through the sites you create. Styles can be implemented in several different ways, but most of your files will be within an external stylesheet. You can define more than one stylesheet within a page, but we\'re going to start off with a site wide default stylesheet for basic page display. Place the following tag within the &lt;head&gt; section of your document, after your title element:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<link href=\"css/default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" lang=\"en\" title=\"Default Site Stylesheet\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOK, there are few things going on here. I have an href reference to the external stylesheet, default.css, which I have saved in my css folder (this location is relative to the document itself, so you may wish to use a dynamic variable here). I have several statements that this is a \'stylesheet\', to be processed as a \'text/css\' document when loaded, that the language used is english, and that the stylesheet is intended to style for the \'screen\'. I also included a title to denote it from other stylesheets I might include later.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next we\'ll create a basic stylesheet to start off with. For this, first create a folder relative to your document titled \'css\', then create a new file within the folder, \'default.css\'. First we\'ll place a comment to explain the document, then define it\'s character set and a few starter styles for our site.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n/*   default.css\r\n//   Created: 07/10/2006\r\n\r\n//   Author:  Cutter\r\n\r\n//   Purpose: A default site-wide stylesheet\r\n\r\n*/\r\n\r\n@CHARSET \"ISO-8859-1\";\r\n\r\nbody {\r\n	text-align: center;\r\n	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n	font-size: 10pt;\r\n	margin-top: 0px; }\r\n\r\ntd {\r\n	font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n	font-size: 10pt; }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlright, we set our character set to the same one we used in the meta tag of our document template, we said that we wanted the contents of the body to be aligned to the center (more on this in a minute), set the font family to be used, the font size (more on this in another session), and that we wanted no top margin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Wait a minute? Why\'d Cutter do the font stuff for the td tag as well?&quot; Well, it\'s a glitch in IE (and maybe Firefox, I\'ve never checked) that your styles won\'t cascade down into your table cells. I don\'t know why, but that\'s the way it is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you may also be asking why I didn\'t place a margin on the left. Well, notice how I aligned everything to the center? That\'s because, before I place anything else into the document I\'m going to add a container element, in between the body tags, to hold everything.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<div id=\"totalBody\">\r\n     <p>Here&rsquo;s the body</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then we\'re going to add another declaration at the bottom of our stylesheet to define our container a little.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#totalBody {\r\n     margin-left: auto;\r\n     margin-right: auto;\r\n     margin-top: 5px;\r\n     width: 999px;\r\n     text-align: left; }\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let me explain. I\'ve set my left and right margins to auto, so as to center my container, with a top margin of only 5 pixels, a width of 999 pixels, and aligning all inside it to the left. I\'ve started making most of my layouts for 1024 x 768 now. Web usage stats are finally showing this above the 70% mark (thank you flat screen monitors). You could do liquid layouts, but I\'m not discussing those within these sessions. I use 999 pixels to account for a (roughly) 25 pixel wide scroll bar, if it\'s needed. If you don\'t like the width, change it. It\'s up to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, this session I\'ll post some example files from what we\'ve discussed. Nothing overly fancy, but if you load up the index.cfm and go into your <a href=\"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/60/\" target=\"_blank\">Web Developer\'s Plugin</a> for <a href=\"getfirefox.com\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox</a>, then select <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Outline &gt; Outline Block Level Elements</span>, then select <span style=\"font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;\">Information &gt; Display ID &amp; Class Details</span>, you\'ll start to get an idea of where you\'re going here.

Most documents/sites need some sort of header block for logos and titles, and maybe even a basic menu. So, first things first, let\'s add in a header area.\r\n<code>\r\n<div id=\"totalBody\">\r\n     <div id=\"headerBlock\">\r\n          <div id=\"headerText\">\r\n               <h2>This is my header block</h2>\r\n          </div>\r\n          <div id=\"headerMenu\">\r\n               <p>Header Menu will go here</p>\r\n          </div>\r\n     </div>\r\n     <p>Here&rsquo;s the body</p>\r\n</div>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, where do we go from here? Let\'s apply some style! Let\'s start off with our header block. I like to use images as backgrounds so that I can easily lay text in a block without worrying about absolute positioning. Currently the big issue with setting width and height attributes on block level elements is the box model. I\'m not going to go into detail on this here, since there is already an extreme amount of information on the net already, but I would suggest you research it at <a href=\"http://www.quirksmode.org\" target=\"_blank\">Quirksmode</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I\'ll take something that I\'ve already sized the way I would like it and place it in the images directory off of my root. Then I\'ll add the following to my stylesheet:\r\n<code>\r\n#headerBlock {\r\n     width: 997px;\r\n     height: 175px;\r\n     color: white;\r\n     background-image: url(\'../images/headerimage.jpg\'); }\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>That will place an image as the background of my entire header block, including behind the menu. Notice that the width is 2 pixels less than the width of the totalBody Div. You might want to look up that Box Model issue. Also notice the url path of the background-image attribute. Your image is relative to the css document itself (except in Netscape 4, but who uses that anymore? [Thanks to Sandy Clark for that tidbit off of CF-Talk last week]). Next we\'ll set the width and height, and such, of the headerText block:\r\n<code>\r\n#headerText {\r\n     width: 995px;\r\n     height: 140px;\r\n     font-weight:bold; }\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, then you can set up your headerMenu block. For horizontal menus I still utilize a table, since data output in a tabular format is what tables are for. Without special styles formatting for it\'s display, a div will always follow directly underneath another div. Knowing that, the menu table I place inside it will be directly below my headerText block. But, that\'s enough for now. Next time around we\'ll place in the menu, and start adding some \'pods\' to our primary content area, after which we\'ll start getting in to the real juice of our series.

Like video games, or cell phones, or karaoke. It\'ll never catch on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, we all know better. Internet popularity blossomed somewhere around 1994, and it\'s only exploded since then. But what does it really mean to the average business today? How do you justify paying for hosting, development and maintenance, in relation to the bottom line? What value does it really serve to your organization? Why does this guy keep asking me questions?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the height of the dot com boom of the mid-nineties everyone was trying to make money \"on the net.\" Trying to find a way to sell goods and services directly on the web. This led to the dot com bust, where most companies discovered that consumers still liked to kick the tires. Sure, e-commerce has grown significantly over the last decade, but nowhere near what was originally being forecasted. A major shift in thinking about the internet was in order. Here was this wonderful piece of technology, becoming more and more accessible by the day to people around the world, but very few could figure out how to make a buck.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After many years of working in the internet industry, in many different vertical markets, I\'ve seen several things that stand out with successful business sites: </p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"1\">\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight:bold;\">The Internet Is A Medium Of Information</li>	\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>A business site does not always mean e-commerce. Most successful business sites provide a bridge between themselves and their consumers, giving them detailed information on all of their products and services. A successful business site gives enough brief overview of it\'s products and services to answer quick questions without the user having to wade through too much information, but also gives them the option to \'drill down\' easily through details they might be searching for. This gives your users enough information to begin making some informed decisions on what they want, and decreases the amount of time they need to spend on the phone, or in your place of business, asking questions and tying up your sales peoples\' time. They walk in, test drive the gold Lotus in the showroom, and write you a check, because they already know the safety ratings, miles per gallon, and what colors they can order it in. A website is a really advanced marketing tool for your business, which can translate into a huge return on investment when utilized well.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"2\">\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Websites Should Always Change...And, They Shouldn\'t</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If the content of a business site never changes then the user has no real reason to return, they saw it all the first time. However, basic layout of the look and feel of a site (headers, footers, navigation) should be decided upon early, finalized, and remain consistent throughout a site. Just like your company logo or that catchy jingle you can\'t get out of your head, a website is an extension of your business\' image, and that branding is just as important. That doesn\'t mean never change the look, adjustments in color and content can go a long way to keeping some interest, but \'branding\' should always be your key. Return visitors want to find things the way they always have, so any changes to usability should be thought out well and assist your users with that in mind. No, changes that keep them coming back are content changes, specials that always change, featured items, updating calendars, advertisements, and company or community information. Changes in inventory do count, but not so much if they already know your product line.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"3\">\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Good Sites Take Feedback</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>Let\'s look at a case study real quick. Amazon sells books. We all know what books feel like (I hope), and you can\'t really judge a book by it\'s cover, so why does Amazon work? Well, it gives you a basic idea about the book, price, cover art, basic contents, maybe a synopsis from the publisher. Amazon also allows other users to write reviews of books, rate the books, go on about the books. Simple forms gather the info from users and redisplay it for everyone. What does this do for them? It gives them a mailing list of people interested in books (good marketing tool if not abused), it provides fresh content for their site, and it tells their users that they are important enough to ask their opinion.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"4\">\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight:bold;\">Successful Businesses Don\'t Abuse Their Clients</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>If you receive seven million spam e-mails from a company, are you likely to use their goods or services anymore? Especially if they don\'t offer you a way out? Every business wants leads, people that they know might be interested in their goods and services. Offering them specials, or informing them about new products can easily be viewed as a service to both them and your company, as long as you don\'t beat it to death. Establishing a solid practice of contact and follow-up, without being viewed as pushy, be it via e-mail, snail mail, or over the phone, can make or break a future sale. And giving those users a way to stop \'subscriptions\' is more than just a courtesy, it\'s a necessity.</p>\r\n\r\n<ol start=\"5\">\r\n	<li style=\"font-weight:bold;\">You Know Your Business Better Than Anybody</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>It\'s great to use companies who know your industry to create a great website for you. Hopefully they give you tools to keep things fresh, rather than giving you something static. Just remember, it\'s still your site. If you don\'t update the calendar, or specials, or advertisements, then the site doesn\'t change and users don\'t come back. Your site developers might provide services for updating inventory on the site, but inventory is expected to be updated, and product lines don\'t change that often. Staying on top of the little things keep you \'in front\' of your users, and that level of control is something that typically can\'t be automated. You know your business, your area, your products, and your clients better than any site builder/provider possibly can, so it\'s up to you to use the tools you\'re given to make a site work for your business.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When scouting out people to build a web presence for your business make sure that they give you the tools you need to make it successful for you. Good looking sites will attract users. Good information that\'s consistently easy to find will keep them there for a while. Respecting your users will keep them loyal. Continuous change will give them reasons to come back for more.</p>','Internet-Presence-Why-Is-It-Pertinent','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1376,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

There are so many things that we, as Americans, take for granted in our lives that we fail to see things from the other perspective.<p> \r\n	\r\n	<p>I\'ve heard people bitch about the fact that they can\'t take a soda on a plane, or a lighter, or their hair conditioner or shaving cream. I\'ve been to countries where the citizens will never ride a plane, because they will never be permitted to leave. While shopping with my wife and daughter I noticed a skirt for sale that would barely cover a woman\'s womanhood, yet the women of many middle eastern countries can not even show their face until after they are married (if they are permitted to leave their home). They remove the ten commandments from a courthouse\'s steps bacause it offends an atheist, yet in some extremist countries a man will be beaten for missing prayer.

Or if Roosevelt asked the question of the Jewish who were being led to Auschwitz? To say that any man, woman, or child does not want to be free is to go against the nature of man, even if that man has been whipped so much, for so long, as to no longer realize it for himself. All children begin with free thought, they are taught to be slaves to conformity. Free thought is the great blessing, and curse, given to us as our birthright from our Creator. Like it or not, everyone wants to be free.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Have we done enough in Afghanistan? Probably not. Have we done too much in Iraq? Maybe so. I don\'t know the answers to these questions. They aren\'t the ones I ask myself each day. The question I ask is the same one I asked myself while I served in the Army; What price are you willing to pay for freedom? I am comforted by the knowledge that, unlike many instances of conflict in our nation\'s history, every man and woman serving in our military today volunteered for the job. They knew what they were doing, and made the decision themselves. They ask that question of themselves everyday, just like the other heroes we honor today: The Police, Fire Fighters, Paramedics, and many others. They all answered the call to stand on the wall and protect us \"from all enemies, foriegn and domestic\".

Are we going about all of this the right way? I think that remains to be seen. I do know that I\'m not the only one keeping a close eye on our civil liberties, as should we all.

CFIF, CFOUTPUT, and CFLOOP are all pretty much the same, but it\'s still good to have an environment to test in that is the same as your production environment. Little did I know that Adobe had stopped permitting the download for the CF5 development server.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Luckily we have an outstanding development community for ColdFusion. After putting out the question to the <a href=\"http://houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">House Of Fusion CF-Talk development list</a>, I received several offers to help me test my code. I\'m glad I did. It\'s been a long time since I\'ve worked with a CF5 environment, and the little things will always get you. Like slight differences in stucture handling. Yes, most structure functions are still the same, but trying to build a structure object in CF5 is only possible once it\'s been implicitly created (i.e.: variables.myStruct = structnew()), otherwise dot notation assignment will error.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another gotcha with CF5 would be scoped variables. In MX+, all scopes are accessible as structure objects, and can be read/manipulated using dot notation. Within CF5 all structures were not accessible as structure objects, for instance the <em>variables</em> scope. To have a structure that is accessible within the variables scope you would first have to implicitly declare it (as mentioned above).</p>\r\n<code>\r\n	<cfscript>\r\n		variables.pageDefaults = structnew();\r\n		variables.pageDefaults.pageTitle = \"Home\";\r\n		variables.pageDefaults.additionalStylesheet = \"home.css\";\r\n		variables.pageDefaults.additionalScripts = \"formValidation.js\";\r\n		variables.pageDefaults.standardNavigation = 0;\r\n	</cfscript>\r\n</code>\r\n<p>After defining your structure in this manner you would be able to do basic existence checking within your code:\r\n<code>\r\n	<cfif structkeyexists(variables.pageDefaults,\"pageTitle\")>\r\n		<title>#variables.pageDefaults.pageTitle#</title>\r\n	<cfelse>\r\n		<title>Some Title</title>\r\n	</cfif>\r\n</code>\r\nIf you had ommitted explicitly declaring variables.pageDefaults through the structnew() method then the following code would have worked within MX+, but errored out on CF5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The moral to this story? There isn\'t one.

So, break it up into these two files.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>incHeader.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\r\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n	<head>\r\n		<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\" />\r\n		<title>Untitled Document</title>\r\n		<link href=\"css/default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" lang=\"en\" title=\"Default Site Stylesheet\" />\r\n	</head>\r\n\r\n	<body>\r\n\r\n		<div id=\"totalBody\">\r\n		     <div id=\"headerBlock\">\r\n		          <div id=\"headerText\">\r\n		               <h2>This is my header block</h2>\r\n		          </div>\r\n		          <div id=\"headerMenu\">\r\n		               <p>Header Menu will go here</p>\r\n		          </div>\r\n		     </div>\r\n		     <div id=\"mainContent\">\r\n			 	<div id=\"navMenu\">\r\n\r\n				</div>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>incFooter.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n			</div>\r\n		</div>\r\n\r\n	</body>\r\n</html>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few things you should begin to notice here. First (and this might not be evident with\r\nthe styles of <a href=\"http://www.blogcfc.com\" target=\"_blank\">BlogCFC</a>, but you should\r\nnotice it in the code downloads) you might notice the indentation of code. Exactly what\r\nshould and should not be indented is an individual preference, but I find it makes life\r\nmuch easier in the long run when trying to track something down and improves readability.\r\nSecond thing you should notice is that each tag either has a closing tag or is a self closing\r\ntag, with the space and slash prior to the closing bracket. This is because XHTML is a\r\ntransitional format language, helping you adjust to the strictly formatted document syntax\r\nyou will later use when you work with XML and XSLT documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next we\'ll param some variables that might be passed into our header template. I asked in\r\na previous tutorial that you think of items within your template that would change page\r\nper page, such as the title, stylesheets, included scripts, etc., so let\'s set up our\r\ntemplate to accept these items. I\'m going to use local variables for this, although you\r\ncould just as easily use the request scope, since these variables would be used only for\r\nthis page request. You want to place these items at the beginning of your document, prior to your\r\ndoctype declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>incHeader.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.pageTitle\" default=\"My Site\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.pageKeywords\" default=\"Page specific keywords for SEO\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.pageDescription\" default=\"Page specific description for SEO\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.pageMetaTags\" default=\"\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.additionalStylesheets\" default=\"\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.additionalScripts\" default=\"\" />\r\n<!--- Navigation Menu variables are paramed to prevent errors --->\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.mainMenu\" default=\"\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.sideNav\" default=\"\" />\r\n<!--- Used by navigation menus --->\r\n<cfparam name=\"variables.siteSection\" default=\"\" />\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next you want to setup these dynamic values within your template. We\'ll start off with those\r\nitems I have precursed with \'page\', as they are simple include values.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>incHeader.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\r\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n	<head>\r\n		<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\" />\r\n		<!--- Dynamic Page Title --->\r\n		<title>#variables.pageTitle#</title>\r\n		<!--- Dynamic MetaTags --->\r\n		<meta name=\"description\" content=\"#variables.pageDescription#\" />\r\n		<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"#variables.pageKeywords#\" />\r\n		<cfif len(trim(variables.pageMetaTags))>\r\n			#variables.pageMetaTags#\r\n		</cfif>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now we\'re getting somewhere! Our next step is adding in for possible multi value variables. In this example we\'ll\r\ntake a comma delimited list of style sheet names or script names, but you could just as easily set this up for\r\narrays, or an array of structs, it\'s up to you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>incHeader.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n		<!--- Default, site-wide style sheet --->\r\n		<link href=\"css/default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" lang=\"en\" title=\"Default Site Stylesheet\" />\r\n		<!---\r\n		//	Loop through additional stylesheets (passed as a list).\r\n		//	Note the lack of \'media\', \'lang\', or \'title\' attributes.\r\n		//	To include those attributes will cause Firefox to not load the stylesheet\r\n		//  (as of 1.5, I haven\'t tested this lack of functionality in 2.0 yet)\r\n		 --->\r\n		<cfif len(trim(variables.additionalStylesheets))>\r\n			<cfloop list=\"#variables.additionalStylesheets#\" index=\"variables.stylesheetName\">\r\n				<link href=\"css/#variables.stylesheetName#\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n			</cfloop>\r\n		</cfif>\r\n		<!--- Global functions javascript file --->\r\n		<script src=\"scripts/glFunctions.js\" language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n		<!--- Loop through a list of file names to include additional javascript files --->\r\n		<cfif len(trim(variables.additionalScripts))>\r\n			<cfloop list=\"#variables.additionalScripts#\" index=\"variables.scriptName\">\r\n				<script src=\"scripts/#variables.scriptName#\" language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n			</cfloop>\r\n		</cfif>\r\n	</head>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I typically use a sitewide default stylesheet for common style formatting (fonts, sizes, common element widths),\r\nand page specific stylesheets for elements specifically within the main content of the page, or overrides to\r\ndefault declarations. I also use a common global functions javascript library for roll over effects, pop-up dialogs,\r\nshow/hide style changes, etc., while including specific javascript libraries only on pages that need them (like\r\nthose that might use AJAX).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next we\'ll include the necessary elements of our body content.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>incHeader.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n	<body>\r\n		<!--- div containing the entire body of the document --->\r\n		<div id=\"totalBody\">\r\n		     <!--- div containing the entire header --->\r\n		     <div id=\"headerBlock\">\r\n		          <div id=\"headerText\">\r\n		               <h2>This is my header block</h2>\r\n		          </div>\r\n		          <div id=\"headerMenu\">\r\n		               #variables.mainMenu#\r\n		          </div>\r\n		     </div>\r\n		     <div id=\"mainContent\">\r\n			 	<div id=\"navMenu\">\r\n					#variables.sideNav#\r\n				</div>\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that is it for our include files, we\'ll leave our footer as we stated above (for now). Next is pretty simple,\r\nhow to include our header and footer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>index.cfm\r\n<code>\r\n<cfscript>\r\n	variables.pageTitle = \"My Site - Home Page\";\r\n	variables.pageKeywords = \"My Site, Home Page, coldfusion, programming, XHTML, javascript, css\";\r\n	variables.pageDescription = \"The My Site Home Page is the gateway into My Site, where many interesting things are bound to be discovered.\";\r\n</cfscript>\r\n<cfsavecontent variable=\"variables.pageMetaTags\">\r\n	<cfoutput>\r\n		<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index,follow\" />\r\n		<meta name=\"revised\" content=\"Cutter, 11/6/06\" />\r\n	</cfoutput>\r\n</cfsavecontent>\r\n<cfscript>\r\n	variables.additionalStylesheet = \"home.css\";\r\n	variables.additionalScripts = \"myajax.js,calcfunct.js\";\r\n	variables.siteSection = \"Home\";\r\n</cfscript>\r\n\r\n<!--- Later we\'ll use the following:\r\n<cfinclude template=\"mainMenu.cfm\" />\r\n<cfinclude template=\"sideNav.cfm\" /> --->\r\n\r\n<cfinclude template=\"incHeader.cfm\" />\r\n\r\n<!--- Here we will now include page content --->\r\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.

In our last tutorial I showed you an old,\r\n	tried-but-true method for including page headers and footers. But, every ColdFusion\r\n	developer knows that there are many different ways. In this tutorial we\'ll go over\r\n	creating the same header and footer using custom tags.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Custom Tags provided a huge level of power to ColdFusion Markup Language, because\r\n	it gave us the ability to write simple and elaborate code snippets that could be\r\n	placed in a centralized repository for consistent reuse. One way to think of them\r\n	is like an include, but with expanded functionality. Let\'s get started.</p>','2006-11-09 23:31:00','<p>We\'re going to create a new folder under our root directory titled <em>cftags</em>, and\r\n	within this a subfolder titled <em>ui</em>. Within the ui folder, create a new template\r\n	called <em>dspMainTemplate.cfm</em>, and copy the contents of your old <em>incHeader.cfm</em>\r\n	into the file.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>The first thing you want to do is make sure that the file is only called as a Custom\r\n	Tag. To do this, just verify that the template has an <em>executionMode</em>, as only\r\n	Custom Tags do. If it isn\'t called as a Custom Tag, then you\'ll want to stop all processing\r\n	and tell someone they\'ve made a mistake.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>dspMainTemplate.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfif NOT IsDefined(\"thisTag.executionMode\")>\r\n	<cfoutput>\r\n		Must be called as customtag.\r\n	</cfoutput>\r\n	<cfabort />\r\n</cfif>\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Next you\'ll want to make sure that a closing tag was included in the calling\r\n	template. If one isn\'t present then you\'ll want to throw an appropriate error\r\n	message.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>dspMainTemplate.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfif NOT thisTag.hasEndTag>\r\n	<cfthrow message=\"Missing end tag.\" />\r\n</cfif>\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>You may remember that our header had <em>cfparam</em>s for the many different\r\n	dynamic variables we had defined as necessary for our header and footer. Custom Tags\r\n	use the <strong>attributes</strong> scope for any variables that are to be passed in.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>dspMainTemplate.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.pageTitle\" default=\"My Site\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.pageKeywords\" default=\"Page specific keywords for SEO\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.pageDescription\" default=\"Page specific description for SEO\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.pageMetaTags\" default=\"\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.additionalStylesheets\" default=\"\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.additionalScripts\" default=\"\" />\r\n<!--- Navigation Menu variables are paramed to prevent errors --->\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.mainMenu\" default=\"\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.sideNav\" default=\"\" />\r\n<!--- Used by navigation menus --->\r\n<cfparam name=\"attributes.siteSection\" default=\"\" />\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Now, down to the nitty gritty. You know from above that we are making a Custom\r\n	Tag that will require an ending tag. This is because your primary page content will\r\n	go between the opening and closing tags, so you\'re going to test for the \'start\' of your\r\n	tag call. That\'s what <em>executionMode</em> is for.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>dspMainTemplate.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfif thisTag.executionMode IS \"start\">\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Next you\'ll have your actual header content, replacing the calls to your dynamic\r\n	variables, so that they will now reference the <em>attributes</em> scope, instead of\r\n	the <em>variables</em> scope.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>dspMainTemplate.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfoutput>\r\n<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Transitional//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-transitional.dtd\">\r\n<html xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml\">\r\n	<head>\r\n		<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\" />\r\n		<!--- Dynamic Page Title --->\r\n		<title>#attributes.pageTitle#</title>\r\n		<!--- Dynamic MetaTags --->\r\n		<meta name=\"description\" content=\"#attributes.pageDescription#\" />\r\n		<meta name=\"keywords\" content=\"#attributes.pageKeywords#\" />\r\n		<cfif len(trim(attributes.pageMetaTags))>\r\n			#attributes.pageMetaTags#\r\n		</cfif>\r\n		<!--- Default, site-wide style sheet --->\r\n		<link href=\"css/default.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" media=\"screen\" lang=\"en\" title=\"Default Site Stylesheet\" />\r\n		<!---\r\n		//	Loop through additional stylesheets (passed as a list).\r\n		//	Note the lack of \'media\', \'lang\', or \'title\' attributes.\r\n		//	To include those attributes will cause Firefox to not load the stylesheet\r\n		//  (as of 1.5, I haven\'t tested this lack of functionality in 2.0 yet)\r\n		 --->\r\n		<cfif len(trim(attributes.additionalStylesheets))>\r\n			<cfloop list=\"#attributes.additionalStylesheets#\" index=\"variables.stylesheetName\">\r\n				<link href=\"css/#variables.stylesheetName#\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" />\r\n			</cfloop>\r\n		</cfif>\r\n		<!--- Global functions javascript file --->\r\n		<script src=\"scripts/glFunctions.js\" language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n		<!--- Loop through a list of file names to include additional javascript files --->\r\n		<cfif len(trim(attributes.additionalScripts))>\r\n			<cfloop list=\"#attributes.additionalScripts#\" index=\"variables.scriptName\">\r\n				<script src=\"scripts/#variables.scriptName#\" language=\"javascript\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n			</cfloop>\r\n		</cfif>\r\n	</head>\r\n	<body>\r\n		<!--- div containing the entire body of the document --->\r\n		<div id=\"totalBody\">\r\n		     <!--- div containing the entire header --->\r\n		     <div id=\"headerBlock\">\r\n		          <div id=\"headerText\">\r\n		               <h2>This is my header block</h2>\r\n		          </div>\r\n		          <div id=\"headerMenu\">\r\n		               #attributes.mainMenu#\r\n		          </div>\r\n		     </div>\r\n		     <div id=\"mainContent\">\r\n			 	<div id=\"navMenu\">\r\n					#attributes.sideNav#\r\n				</div>\r\n</cfoutput>\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Wow!

But wait! There\'s more! Lucky contestants will also learn how to\r\n	call the custom template! First we need to import the Custom Tag for use. By using \r\n	<em>cfimport</em> you are able to import all of the tags within a specific directory\r\n	as well as set a unique identifier for referring to those tags.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>index.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfimport prefix=\"ui\" taglib=\"/blogproject/cftags/ui\">\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>One of the first things you\'ll notice in the following code is that\r\n	I am still writing many of my dynamic variables to the <em>variables</em> scope initially.\r\n	This is for convenience, because many of these variables could be quite large, so it is\r\n	easier to \'set\' them first and then pass them to the Custom Tag\'s attributes.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>index.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<cfscript>\r\n	variables.pageTitle = \"My Site - Home Page\";\r\n	variables.pageKeywords = \"My Site, Home Page, coldfusion, programming, XHTML, javascript, css\";\r\n	variables.pageDescription = \"The My Site Home Page is the gateway into My Site, where many interesting things are bound to be discovered.\";\r\n</cfscript>\r\n<cfsavecontent variable=\"variables.pageMetaTags\">\r\n	<cfoutput>\r\n		<meta name=\"robots\" content=\"index,follow\" />\r\n		<meta name=\"revised\" content=\"Cutter, 11/9/06\" />\r\n	</cfoutput>\r\n</cfsavecontent>\r\n<cfscript>\r\n	variables.additionalStylesheets = \"home.css\";\r\n	variables.additionalScripts = \"myajax.js,calcfunct.js\";\r\n	variables.siteSection = \"Home\";\r\n</cfscript>\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Next we\'ll create our \'start\' tag, passing in all of the attributes needed by the\r\n	tag. We\'ll follow that with some content, and then write our closing tag.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>index.cfm\r\n	<code>\r\n<ui:dspMainTemplate pageTitle=\"#variables.pageTitle#\"\r\n		pageKeywords=\"#variables.pageKeywords#\"\r\n		pageDescription=\"#variables.pageDescription#\"\r\n		pageMetaTags=\"#variables.pageMetaTags#\"\r\n		additionalStylesheets=\"#variables.additionalStylesheets#\"\r\n		additionalScripts=\"#variables.additionalScripts#\"\r\n		siteSection=\"#variables.siteSection#\">\r\n\r\n<!--- Here we will now include page content --->\r\n\r\n</ui:dspMainTemplate>\r\n	</code></p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Voila! It\'s that easy. Sure, you can make it as complicated as you wish, but we\r\n	just want to cover some basics in these tutorials. Using the same template file you\r\n	could also use the the old &gt;cf_myTag&lt; syntax as well, without importing all\r\n	of the tags in a folder, but I tend to organize my tags in such a way that all of\r\n	the ones I might need for certain tasks are located in one folder and only called\r\n	when they are needed.</p>\r\n	\r\n	<p>Anyway, that\'s it for this go around. Next time out maybe we\'ll start exploring our\r\n	base template from within a framework? What do ya\'ll think?

 ('D620662D-3048-71C2-1740F5EB922090C6','Making The View: Part 7','<p>OK, so let\'s get interesting. We\'ve covered creating a base template in <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/xhtml/\"\r\n		target=\"_blank\">XHTML</a>, properly divided our\r\n		display declarations from our content by using <a href=\"http://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp\"\r\n		target=\"_blank\">Cascading Style Sheets</a>, and pinpointed some areas within\r\n		the base template which should be dynamic. Finally, in our <a href=\"/index.cfm/2006/11/9/Making-The-View-Part-6\"\r\n		target=\"_blank\">previous tutorial</a>, we brought all of this\r\n		together in a reusable template, which we demonstrated by using it as a custom tag. Now we\'re going to\r\n		really start having some fun, by redefining our view within some frameworks. Now, I\'m no expert. There\r\n		are probably a few dozen ways to properly handle the view within the different frameworks, so any\r\n		other suggestions are welcome as always. We\'re going to start off with <a href=\"http://www.model-glue.com\"\r\n		target=\"_blank\">Model Glue:Unity</a>, while I catch\r\n		up on the changes to <a href=\"http://www.mach-ii.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mach II</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fusebox.org\"\r\n		target=\"_blank\">Fusebox</a>.</p>','2006-12-30 20:23:00','<p>You\'ll begin by creating a new application from the modelglueapplicationtemplate. (For thorough\r\n		information on working with Model Glue you should check out the <a href=\"http://docs.model-glue.com\" \r\n		target=\"_blank\">Model Glue Documentation</a>, and for a brief overview you can check out\r\n		<a href=\"/index.cfm/2006/10/26/NCFUG-Model-GlueUnity-Preso\" target=\"_blank\">\r\n		my presentation</a> .) From there the rest is actually pretty easy. To begin,\r\n		there is already a \'template\' file within the modelglueapplicationtemplate, dspTemplate. Now it comes\r\n		down to some adjustments. First, let\'s look at how you can pass your \'dynamic\' content values. You\r\n		can define these items through your ModelGlue.xml file:</p>\r\n		\r\n		<p>ModelGlue.xml\r\n		<code>\r\n...\r\n<event-handler name=\"page.index\">\r\n	<broadcasts /> \r\n	<results>\r\n		<result do=\"view.template\" />\r\n	</results>\r\n	<views>\r\n		< include name=\"body\" template=\"dspIndex.cfm\">\r\n			<value name=\"pageTitle\" value=\"Home Page\" />\r\n			<value name=\"pageKeywords\" value=\"My Site, Home Page, coldfusion, programming, XHTML, javascript, css\" />\r\n			<value name=\"pageDescription\" value=\"The My Site Home Page is the gateway into My Site, where many interesting things are bound to be discovered.\" />\r\n			<value name=\"additionalStyleSheets\" value=\"home.css\" />\r\n			<value name=\"additionalScripts\" value=\"myajax.js,calcfunct.js\" />\r\n			<value name=\"siteSection\" value=\"Home\" />\r\n		</include>\r\n	</views>\r\n</event-handler>\r\n...\r\n		</code></p>\r\n		\r\n		<p>You see all of the familiar variables that we had used within our previous tutorial. Now it\'s time to\r\n		see how they get called from within our display template. At the start of our dspTemplate.cfm file we\'ll\r\n		test for, and set, our variables:</p>\r\n		\r\n		<p>dspTemplate.cfm\r\n		<code>\r\n...\r\n<cfset variables.pageTitle = \"My Site: \" />\r\n<cfset variables.pageTitle = variables.pageTitle & viewState.getValue(\"pageTitle\",\"Home\") />\r\n<cfset variables.pageKeywords = viewState.getValue(\"pageKeywords\",\"\") />\r\n<cfset variables.pageDescription = viewState.getValue(\"pageDescription\",\"\") />\r\n<cfset variables.additionalStyleSheets = viewState.getValue(\"additionalStyleSheets\",\"\") />\r\n<cfset variables.additionalScripts = viewState.getValue(\"additionalScripts\",\"\") />\r\n<cfset variables.siteSection = viewState.getValue(\"siteSection\",\"\") />\r\n...\r\n		</code></p>\r\n		\r\n		<p>The getValue() method of the viewState is kind of like using <em>cfparam</em> in that it looks for\r\n		a variable and serves it up, or lets you define a default if it isn\'t present. After this the majority\r\n		of the template is unchanged, except for those areas where we begin to fill in content. Let\'s say\r\n		you\'re writing your home page. Well, in Model Glue it all starts with the ModelGlue.xml, which we\r\n		showed you in our first code block. From that code you\'ll notice the <em>include</em> tag to set\r\n		your \'body\'. Within your dspTemplate.cfm you\'ll need to verify the existence of \'body\', and then\r\n		display it if it is available:</p>\r\n		\r\n		<p>dspTemplate.cfm\r\n		<code>\r\n...\r\n<cfif viewCollection.exists(\"body\")>\r\n	#viewCollection.getView(\"body\")#\r\n</cfif>\r\n...\r\n		</code></p>\r\n		\r\n		<p>And...that\'s it. Now, there are other ways to do it of course. You might only have a single <em>value</em>\r\n		tag to every <em>include</em> containing some page id that is passed to the controller on page load to\r\n		pull your dynamic template bits from a database to then pass back to your template.

A brief description of what the template does is included next, followed by the name and email of the author of the template (only to be used on new documents), and the copyright notice. The final area is the revision history. This is the most important area within this documentation, as every change made to a template will be documented here, with the most current revision being the top item then going downward for each revision made to a template. Each revision will be listed with as much detail as possible, stating the initials of the developer making a change and the date that it was modified. Similar revision notes should also be made inline within the document at the location of any revisions, with the same data included (initials and date stamp). You should also note the <em>cfsetting</em> tags. These are utilized to minimize white space output in the generated page, and are only used within .cfm templates, but require the developer to pay close attention to the code contained between them, as display code will only be rendered if it exists within <em>cfoutput</em>tags (or within the <em>writeoutput()</em> statement of a <em>cfscript</em> block.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Inline revisions:\r\n<code>\r\n<!---\r\n//	SGB [11/27/2006]:	Added a param in the event that the value is not included within the querystring\r\n --->\r\n<cfparam name=\"url.event\" default=\"\" />\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>JavaScript example:\r\n<code>\r\n/*\r\n//	Function to validate a form\r\n//  Input: fields array of fields to be validated\r\n\r\n//  Output: boolean value for success or failure\r\n\r\n*/\r\nfunction validateForm(fldsObj){\r\n	success = 1;\r\n	//  Validation processing would reset \'success\' on failure\r\n\r\n	return success;\r\n}\r\n</code></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Comments are handled differently with different languages:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>ColdFusion (CFML) - &lt;!--- Comment ---&gt;</li>\r\n	<li>HTML/XHTML - &lt;!-- Comment --&gt;</li>\r\n	<li>Cascading Style Sheet - /* Comment */</li>\r\n	<li>ColdFusion (CFScript), JavaScript, Flash/ActionScript - \r\n		<ul>\r\n			<li>Multiline - /* Comment */</li>\r\n			<li>Single Line - // Comment</li>\r\n		</ul></li>\r\n</ul></p>','Comments','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',4210,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 ('1D59BA4E-3048-71C2-176B5C4550939397','Variables and Naming Conventions','<textblock label=\"CGLIntro\">\r\n\r\n<p>Variables. They define the data within our applications. Hard to peg down within our system, with thousands of variables over thousands of files. For this reason, it is time to define proper variable declaration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Variable naming conventions and scoping can be very different in different programming languages. Within ColdFusion variables are case insensitive, whereas in most others proper case is critical. With the wide mix of languages used here (XHTML, CSS, ActionScript, JavaScript, etc.) we will take the stance that all variables, across all platforms, should remain case specific unless explicitly necessary to change. A <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase\" target=\"_blank\">camel case</a> approach should be used, with the first letter of the first word (or one word) of a variable remaining lower case, while any subsequent word is capitalized. i.e.: oneVariable, anotherVariable, stillAnotherVariable. (Functions should capitalize each word) You may also employ <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_notation\" target=\"_blank\">Hungarian Notation</a> to further identify the type of a variable, if you wish, but it won\'t (at this time) be required.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another important action with variables is declaring, and referencing them, from their proper scope. In ColdFusion, you could reference most variables without identifying the <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/6/Developing_ColdFusion_MX_Applications_with_CFML/Variables7.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scope</a>, but to do so would cause unnecessary load on our systems. When a template is processed by ColdFusion, if the <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/6/Developing_ColdFusion_MX_Applications_with_CFML/Variables7.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scope</a> is not identified then the server will search through each <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/6/Developing_ColdFusion_MX_Applications_with_CFML/Variables7.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scope</a> separately until the variable is found. Not only does this cause the system to overwork, but you also run the risk of the system discovering a variable of the same name within a higher <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/6/Developing_ColdFusion_MX_Applications_with_CFML/Variables7.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scope</a> of the search tree. By expressly referencing all variables by their scope you eliminate these possible issues within our system. Also (within ColdFusion) all <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/coldfusion/6/Developing_ColdFusion_MX_Applications_with_CFML/Variables7.htm\" target=\"_blank\">scope</a> names should be listed in all uppercase. i.e.: FORM.strUserName, SESSION.intUserID, URL.intStartRow.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Flash</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Although they\'ve been used in the past, <b>_global</b> and <b>_root</b> scopes should only be used cautiously.  As we integrate more of our tools into each other, these scopes can easily cause problems.  <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flash/mx2004/main_7_2/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=Flash_MX_2004&file=00000846.html\">Local Variables</a> should be used in functions when possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adobe has a detailed document on best practices on <a href=\"http://livedocs.macromedia.com/flash/mx2004/main_7_2/wwhelp/wwhimpl/common/html/wwhelp.htm?context=Flash_MX_2004&file=00000846.html\">using scope</a> in ActionScript.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use variable/instance names that describe the functionality of the the item being named.  Append an underscore then the ActionScript abbreviation for the type or variable or instance when appropriate.  This will make code hinting available in the Flash IDE.  For example, <strong>next_btn</strong>, or <strong>submitForm_lv</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Use anonymous functions when appropriate, so as not to clutter the code with named trivial functions.  Example:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n/*Not this way:*/\r\nfunction nextButtonPress(){\r\n    timeline.nextFrame();\r\n}\r\nnext_btn.onRelease = nextButtonPress;\r\n\r\n/*Rather, this way:*/\r\nnext_btn.onRelease = function(){\r\n    timeline.nextFrame();\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<h3>Database Architecture</h3>\r\n\r\n<h4>Table Names</h4>\r\nTable names should be camel case, but with the first letter capitalized as well.  Table names should not be the pluralized form of what it stores.  Example: <strong>ProductItemDetail</strong>\r\n\r\nLinking or Lookup tables which serve as a relationship between a Many-to-Many should include the word <strong><em>Map</em></strong> in the name, preferrably at the end. Example: <strong>ProductItemCategoryMap</strong>\r\n\r\n<h4>Column Data Types</h4>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li><strong>boolean</strong>: Boolean values are stored in bit columns, and have historically been named <strong>b<em>VerbWhatever</em></strong>, for example <strong>bIsCertified</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>foreign keys</strong>: Foreign key column names should be <strong>fk<em>TableName</em></strong>, for example <strong>fkProductItemDetail</strong>.</li>\r\n<li><strong>hex color</strong>: Hexadecimal colors are stored in char(6) fields.</li>\r\n<li>All fields that store numeric data should be of datatype INT(4) except for very special circumstances.\r\n</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>SQL</h3>\r\n<p>SQL keywords should appear in ALL CAPS.  Tables should be aliased.  For example:</p>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nSELECT		PID.displayName,\r\n						PID.description\r\nFROM			ProductItemDetail PID WITH (NOLOCK)\r\nWHERE		PID.ID = #arguments.itemDetailID#\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n<p>All Joins should be specified in the FROM clause.\r\nFor Example:</p>\r\n<code>\r\nSELECT PI.Make, PICM.Price\r\nFROM ProductItem PI WITH(NOLOCK)\r\nINNER JOIN ProductItemCategoryMap PICM WITH(NOLOCK) ON PI.fkItem= PICM.fkItem\r\n</code>\r\n\r\n\r\n<p>There are, always, exceptions to the rules. Typically these exceptions are due to the rules of another language. For instance, within <a href=\"http://www.stylusstudio.com/xmldev/200109/post70770.html\" target=\"_blank\">XHTML all tag names, attributes, and attribute values are always lower case</a>. The exception to that rule is anything calling a script function (like the event actions) where case is defined by the JavaScript itself (which is case sensative).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Examples:\r\n<code>\r\n<!--- ColdFusion variables --->\r\n<cfset VARIABLES.strNextPage = \"myNextPage.cfm\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"URL.intRowStart\" default=\"1\" />\r\n\r\n<cffunction name=\"GetNextPage\" access=\"public\" output=\"false\" returntype=\"string\">\r\n	<cfreturn VARIABLES.strNextPage />\r\n</cffunction>\r\n\r\n/*Flash variables*/\r\n\r\nselectedElements = {};\r\n\r\npropCount = function(obj){\r\n	var count = 0;\r\n	for (var i in obj){\r\n		count++;\r\n	}\r\n	return count;\r\n}\r\n\r\ndelete_btn.onRelease = function(){\r\n	if (propCount(selectedElements) == 0){\r\n		this._parent.error_mc._visible = true;\r\n	} else {\r\n		this._parent.error_mc._visible = false;\r\n		deleteElements(selectedElements);\r\n	}\r\n}\r\n\r\n</code>\r\n</p>','2007-01-13 16:25:00',NULL,'Variables-and-Naming-Conventions','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',5672,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

You must read on...)\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<form name=\"form1\" id=\"form1\" action=\"process.cfm\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\r\n<div id=\"section-1\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n    <ul class=\"anchors\">\r\n		<li><a href=\"#form1_step1\">Step 1</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"#form1_step2\">Step 2</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"#form1_step3\">Step 2</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	<div id=\"form1_step1\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n		<input type=\"text\" name=\"field1\" id=\"field1\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"form1_step2\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n		<input type=\"text\" name=\"field2\" id=\"field2\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"form1_step3\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n		<input type=\"text\" name=\"field3\" id=\"field3\" /><br />\r\n		<input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" value=\"Post Form\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</form>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nStructurally this makes sense. Since our form is spread across the multiple tags we need the opening and closing form tags around the entire form. The problem here is our tab set now breaks, the display of our .fragment div containers no longer work. So, I went back and forth one morning/afternoon, in the comments section on Klaus\'s blog. Klaus was very helpful, and once he understood what I was trying to do he said \"Why don\'t you use the Form as your container?\" Wow, thirteen years writing HTML and I never thought of the form tags as a container set. So, I gave it a go.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<form name=\"section-1\" id=\"section-1\" class=\"fragment\" action=\"process.cfm\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\r\n    <ul class=\"anchors\">\r\n		<li><a href=\"#form1_step1\">Step 1</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"#form1_step2\">Step 2</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"#form1_step3\">Step 2</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n	<div id=\"form1_step1\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n		<input type=\"text\" name=\"field1\" id=\"field1\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"form1_step2\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n		<input type=\"text\" name=\"field2\" id=\"field2\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"form1_step3\" class=\"fragment\">\r\n		<input type=\"text\" name=\"field3\" id=\"field3\" /><br />\r\n		<input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" value=\"Post Form\" />\r\n	</div>\r\n</form>\r\n\r\n<!-- This also requires changes to your tab set calls -->\r\n$(\'#section-1\').tabs({fxAutoHeight: true, tabStruct: \'form\'});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBam! Nested tab sets with forms. A big Thank You to Klaus for helping me work that one out. This JQuery stuff is bang on, and the community is very active. I even used the <a href=\"http://methvin.com/jquery/jq-corner-demo.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rounded Corners</a> plugin to apply rounded corners to tops of the tags (Though it only works in Firefox).

 ('02AB38AF-3048-71C2-170F1CEC0892FFA8','The Current ColdFusion Job Market','I found myself, again, at a crossroads. Recently I decided to update my resume.

I had been in my current position for sixteen months, learned a few things, accomplished various goals, and thought it would be a good idea.','2007-04-17 23:00:00','As I completed the first update I looked at the setting where I had the option to keep the profile private or make it public. I said to myself, \"Self,\" because that\'s what I call myself, \"Self, let\'s make it public and see what happens.\" Couldn\'t hurt. What\'s the worst that could happen?\r\n\r\nMy last job search took three months before I had massaged my resume in such a way as to be recognized for a development position. After being an IT Director for three years it wasn\'t easy getting back into core development. This time around was a little different, and I definitely learned a little about the market today in the process. Day one I recieved eight phone calls and nineteen emails, and continued to receive at least five calls a week for almost two months. I\'ve responded to every email that his been sent to me, of which there have been more the 200. I had 9 phone interviews, three face-to-face (with one out of state), received three separate offers, plus had one that was waiting to submit an offer after getting notice on a government contract award. The last one hadn\'t even met me, they were going off the phone interviews alone. The jobs are out there, and I want to share with you some of the things I have noticed.\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Get Certified</strong> - I\'ve never held much stock in certifications. I\'m almost entirely self taught, and believe that experience is the best teacher. But I recently decided to go ahead and take the ColdFusion Certification Exam, after being a ColdFusion developer for the past seven years. It helps. People notice that you\'ve taken the time to \'prove\' your skill, which is an important asset if most of your development sits behind a firewall.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Learn Frameworks</strong> - Even if you don\'t use them day-to-day, a better than average understanding of frameworks, their differences, and what they can do for you <em>do</em> show that you are more than a hobbyist or a hack. Not to say that there aren\'t real developers out there who don\'t use frameworks, but it shows that you\'re willing to explore new avenues of honing your craft.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Get Involved</strong> - (CF) Community involvement shows that you try to stay current in your knowledge, and are willing to contribute on a team level (even if it is a broad team). Active participation in forums, mailing lists and open source projects help the community-at-large, by both providing useful tools for fellow developers and by mentoring junior developers. I began this blog to give a little back to the community that helped me learn along the way, but by doing so I have also made myself \'known.\' I wasn\'t expecting that when I started this. You would definitely call it a hidden benefit.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Become Well Rounded</strong> - Learn the skills that surround your core value. ColdFusion is a web development language, and employers are looking for people who know web technologies. ColdFusion, without XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, and XML, is useless for an advanced position. And knowledge of SQL, beyond basic CRUD and simple select statements, is essential.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>The More You Know</strong> - Web 2.0 may be a buzzword, but companies know that RIAs (AJAX, Flash, and Flex) are hot. They want it. They want it bad, and they\'re willing to pay more to those who know and understand it.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Learn Flex</strong> - I have a small line at the bottom of my resume that is a list of \'Self Study\' items. In this list I included Flex, since I have begun to learn it (and love it). That one word accounted for at least 30% of all communications in the past two months. The demand is deep, and the talent pool shallow. If you apply yourself to learning only one \'language\' outside of the core set, Flex is the one you want.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Apollo Is Next</strong> - At the time I updated my resume Apollo hadn\'t yet been released, but I\'d bank on a similar reaction.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>ColdFusion Is Getting Stronger</strong> - During my last job search I didn\'t even see 200 postings in a six month period. ColdFusion is beginning to bypass any stigmas that may have been associated with it, not only as a true Rapid Application Development language but also as an enterprise level development platform. All of us have known it for years, and now corporate America is catching up fast (and when Scorpio is released they won\'t know what hit \'em.)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nIt was a very difficult decision for my family and I, but ultimately I decided to accept an offer that allowed me to stay right here in Nashville. I like it here, my family likes it here. But, it\'s nice to know that the next time around I have options that weren\'t previously available to me. Hopefully the list above will allow some of you, dear readers, to expand your options as well.','The-Current-ColdFusion-Job-Market','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',4676,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

In fact I enjoy the art of writing code, it\'s kinda like working on puzzles day in and day out, and I like a good puzzle. On the other hand I think it\'s also smart not to re-invent the wheel. Many minds have dealt with the same problems that I encounter every day, and someone has probably found a solution by now. Why fight that?','2007-04-24 22:41:00','So I keep snippets of valuable code that I find, read a lot of lists and blogs, and learn frameworks that can help me speed my tasks. Like <a href=\"http://www.jquery.org\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a>, an excellent cross-browser JavaScript library for simplifying DOM access and manipulation. I\'ve been having some fun learning JQuery, and enjoying the speed and flexibility with which it allows me to create some very nice, interactive user interfaces. But things have recently gotten even better. Jack Slocum, creator of the truly slick Yahoo User Interface Extensions library, has ported his library over so that it may now also be used by JQuery or Prototype/Script.ac.u.lous. This means that one can enjoy the power and the beauty of these great UI component libraries from within the context of the JQuery framework.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that I set out to do, once downloading the necessary script files, was to figure out how to create grids. DataGrids are one of the most challenging things to write and master, whether it\'s cfform based, Flex, or anything. The Ext library has some really slick and extensible grid components within the framework that can really take your \'table\' data to new levels. I immediately set out to adjust the included sample for a paging grid, meaning a grid that contains <em>n</em> of <em>x</em> recordsets, with buttons to <strong>page</strong> to the next <em>y</em> records. With these grids you have the capability of using AJAX to handle your next/previous navigation without requiring a page reload, sort on any column, resize column widths, and even apply custom cell renderers.\r\n\r\nOver the next several posts I\'m going to show you step by step how I discovered how to use this component of this great UI library. Some of this I will fumble through, as I\'m learning as I go as well, but hopefully it will give you an idea of what you can do. I welcome any comments, criticisms, support, and suggestions along the way. A few of the things to be covered are:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Writing a Paging Query Page</li>\r\n	<li>Defining the DataStore</li>\r\n	<li>Creating a ColumnModel to map to your query results</li>\r\n	<li>Defining and Implementing Custom Cell Renderers</li>\r\n	<li>Rendering and Styling your grid</li>\r\n	<li>Write A Custom Event Handler</li>\r\n	<li>And Probably More...</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nSo, this tutorial will be an accounting of my journey along the way. Hopefully someone will find this very helpful, since there is still very limited tutorial/documentation available on the new <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS site</a>.

First things first, you\'ll need the <a href=\"http://www.jquery.org\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a> and <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS</a> libraries. I also found out (the hard way, since it\'s not in the install notes) that you\'ll need the <a href=\"http://dev.jquery.com/browser/trunk/plugins/dimensions/dimensions.js?format=txt\" target=\"_blank\">Dimensions JQuery Plugin</a>. The <a href=\"http://extjs.com/download\" target=\"_blank\">full ExtJS download</a> contains the project core files, JS library \'adapter\' files, all of the Ext components, examples, documentation, and a \'resource\' directory of images and stylesheets to help you get started.\r\n\r\nI start off by placing the necessary script tags in the <em>head</em>er of my document. Order of placement is important.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jquery/jquery.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/jquery/plugins/dimensions.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/ext-1.0/adapter/jquery/ext-jquery-adapter.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/ext-1.0/ext-all.js\"></script>\r\n<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"js/paging.js\"></script>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\" href=\"resources/css/ext-all.css\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow, for reference, you don\'t need the \'all\' ext library for this to work, but I\'m just doing personal testing right now and figured that it\'s easier than breaking things out at this point. The \'all\' library is the complete component collection, core, and utilities within one script file. While nice to have it all, it is large, and you can use just the components you need. The \'<a href=\"http://extjs.com/download/build\" target=\"_blank\">Build your own Ext</a>\' section of the ExtJS site can show you all of the necessary dependencies to put together only what you need.\r\n\r\nI\'m going to copy the <em>paging.js</em> file out of the ExtJS example directory and place it in the root of my <em>js</em> directory. I\'m going to adjust this existing file to create my first paging grid. I know that this works, so I might as well not re-write the wheel. You\'ll also noticed that I used the included stylesheet file from the <em>resources</em> directory. Now, with all of this in place, all I need is my container div that will hold my DataGride. In the <em>body</em> of my document I place the following container code:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	<div id=\"topic-grid\" style=\"border:1px solid #99bbe8;overflow: hidden; width: 665px; height: 300px;\"></div>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd that\'s the end of the initial setup. In part 3 I\'ll cover creating a paging sql page that will only call the records needed for each \'view\' in our paging grid, returning the records in an XML format to be consumed by our grid. Until then, take a good look at the \'examples\' directory in your ExtJS download, as well as the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext/docs/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">API and Examples</a> section of <a href=\"http://extjs.com/learn-about-ext-javascript-library\" target=\"_blank\">Learn</a> area of the ExtJS site.

 ('3FFB267C-3048-71C2-1725EB387E2B5F96','My First ExtJS DataGrid Pt 3: A Paging Query','OK, we\'re cooking with crisco now. You\'ve probably taken a little time to look through the examples a little bit by now, and you\'ve seen a little of what the paging grid looks like and can do, along with the many other examples. Our last tutorial covered <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">setting things up</a>, but before we dive into the JavaScript we\'ll need some data.\r\n\r\nNow, the paging example that\'s included with the Ext download calls an external PHP page to retrieve the necessary JSON dataset. JSON is great, being small and lightweight, but I\'m working with MS SQL at work, which can return XML data. Since the library has built in proxies for dealing with either, I change it up to take in the XML.\r\n\r\nEach database has different ways of writing a \'paging\' query. MySQL makes it really easy by providing multiple arguments for the LIMIT statement. MS SQL makes it a little harder. See, the trick is to only pull in the records, on each db call, that you actually need. Some people pull the entire recordset and then use a query-of-query to poll their required data, but if you\'re dealing with very large datasets then it makes more sense to only pull what your need when the time comes. I found a great article on MSDN (which I can no longer find) that gives a good suggestion on how to approach this, by using multiple sub select statements. But, the first thing we\'ll do is define some default parameters for those that will eventually be passed in on the AJAX calls.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfparam name=\"URL.start\" default=\"0\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"FORM.start\" default=\"#URL.start#\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"URL.limit\" default=\"25\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"FORM.limit\" default=\"#URL.limit#\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"URL.dir\" default=\"DESC\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"FORM.dir\" default=\"#URL.dir#\">\r\n<cfparam name=\"URL.sort\" default=\"vcLastName\" />\r\n<cfparam name=\"FORM.sort\" default=\"#URL.sort#\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nFirst thing you probably noticed is that I have a FORM scoped variable that matches every URL scoped variable, defaulting the URL var first then defaulting the FORM var to the URL var\'s value. What this allows me to do is testing. I can call the page without any additional info and it will properly run, since I have defaulted all values, and I can tag on query string variables for initial output testing, or tap it directly from a form post. These variables are pretty basic: \'start\' is the starting record row, \'limit\' is the number of records to be returned, \'dir\' is the sort order, and \'sort\' is the column to sort on. After this we move to the query itself.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	SELECT	(SELECT COUNT(ID) AS recCount FROM tblUsers) AS recCount,\r\n			ID,\r\n			vcFirstName,\r\n			vcLastName,\r\n			bIsAdministrator,\r\n			bIsActive,\r\n			tsDateLastLogin\r\n	FROM  ( SELECT TOP #FORM.limit# ID,\r\n					vcFirstName,\r\n					vcLastName,\r\n					bIsAdministrator,\r\n					bIsActive,\r\n					tsDateLastLogin\r\n			FROM   (SELECT TOP #FORM.start + FORM.limit# ID,\r\n							vcFirstName,\r\n							vcLastName,\r\n							bIsAdministrator,\r\n							bIsActive,\r\n							tsDateLastLogin\r\n	    			FROM (SELECT TOP #FORM.start + FORM.limit# ID,\r\n								vcFirstName,\r\n								vcLastName,\r\n								bIsAdministrator,\r\n								bIsActive,\r\n								tsDateLastLogin\r\n						FROM tblUsers AS T1\r\n						WHERE tsDateLastLogin IS NOT NULL\r\n	         			ORDER BY #FORM.sort# ) AS T2\r\n	         		WHERE tsDateLastLogin IS NOT NULL\r\n					ORDER BY #FORM.sort# DESC ) AS T3\r\n			WHERE tsDateLastLogin IS NOT NULL) AS T4\r\n	WHERE tsDateLastLogin IS NOT NULL\r\n	ORDER BY #FORM.sort# #FORM.dir#\r\n	FOR		XML AUTO, ELEMENTS\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice a few things here. I only call the columns that I need. The two inner most sub selects use the TOP functionality to retrieve the \'start\' row number plus the \'limit\', so if you \'limit\' yourself to 25 records and you are now calling page 3 (which would start with row 50) then you would say in these statements \'retrieve the TOP 50+25 rows\', with the first sub-select then only asking for the \'limit\' of the TOP 25. This gives you the TOP 25 rows of 50+25. You also see that a COUNT was added to the first select. Although this number appears in each record as \'recCount\', it also gives you the total number of records that could be returned, thereby giving us the ability to say \'these are rows 50 thru 75 out of 38,543 records.\'\r\n\r\nIf you cfdump the query return you will see multiple query rows returned, but nothing like you might expect. We now have to convert the returned query into a properly formated XML string. For this I use a function that <a href=\"http://www.infoaccelerator.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Andrew Powell</a> showed us in a <a href=\"http://mmusergroup.adobe.acrobat.com/p13001596/\" target=\"_blank\">Spry presentation</a> that he did for the <a href=\"http://www.ncfug.com\" target=\"_blank\">Nashville ColdFusion User Group</a>. This was something that one of his compadres at <a href=\"http://universalmind.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Universal Mind</a> wrote, and that I\'ve adjusted slightly here.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cffunction name=\"sqlXMLtoCFXML\" access=\"public\" output=\"false\" returntype=\"any\">\r\n	<cfargument name=\"doc\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\" default=\"xml\" />\r\n	<cfargument name=\"qry\" type=\"query\" required=\"true\" />\r\n	<cfscript>\r\n		var x = \"\";\r\n		var y = \"\";\r\n		var retXML = \"\";\r\n		x = listFirst(ARGUMENTS.qry.columnList);\r\n		for (y=1;y lte ARGUMENTS.qry.recordCount;y=y+1){\r\n			retXML = retXML & ARGUMENTS.qry[x][y];\r\n		}\r\n		retXML = \"<\" & ARGUMENTS.doc & \">\" & retXML & \"</\" & ARGUMENTS.doc & \">\";\r\n	</cfscript>\r\n	<cfreturn retXML />\r\n</cffunction>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBasically this will take your MS SQL query output and format it into a proper XML document, with the ability for you to also define the \'root\' element (doc). I keep this function in a utility library so that I can call it at anytime. I then take the return of this and output it between some cfcontent tags with a type of \'text/xml\' to get a dynamic xml doc to be consumed by these AJAX calls. \r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfcontent type=\"text/xml\"><cfoutput>#sqlXMLtoCFXML(VARIABLES.qryReturned)#</cfoutput></cfcontent>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe Ext library makes the call to the pages via a form post, then inspects the XML return to map fields to their assigned grid columns. \r\n\r\nBut, that\'s another lesson. This wraps it up for today. Tune in next time (same Bat-time, same Bat-channel) for our next installment: Defining the DataStore.\r\n\r\n<strike>P.S. Sample files will be added to this post sometime tomorrow.</strike>\r\n\r\nThe sample files are now included in the download area below.

 ('58F9280F-3048-71C2-17D81D57EFA20A93','My First ExtJS DataGrid Pt 4: The Data Store','So, up until now we have setup our support files and written our paging query service. Now it\'s time to begin tying our data to our DataGrid. The <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ext library</a> provides you many different ways of pulling in data into the components. We\'re going to create a data \'Store\' using a combination of the HttpProxy (a utility for pulling data from within the same domain) and the XmlReader (for parsing our returned datasets).\r\n\r\nA \'Store\' is \"a client side cache of <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext/docs/output/Ext.data.Record.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ext.data.Record</a> objects which provide input data for widgets.\" Basically you create this representation of your server side data by defining where it is and what it looks like. We\'re using the HttpProxy, in this case, because our service script (pagingService.cfm) resides within the same domain as our calling page. And, since we set our service script to return an XML document, we need the XmlReader to \'map\' the data that we need.\r\n\r\nFirst we\'ll setup the basic block\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar ds = new Ext.data.Store({\r\n\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAdd in the location of our service script\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar ds = new Ext.data.Store({\r\n	// load using HTTP\r\n    proxy: new Ext.data.HttpProxy({url: \'http://cc.mytestserver.loc/jTesting/xmlSqlTest.cfm\'}),\r\n\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThen we set up our XML \'reader\'\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar ds = new Ext.data.Store({\r\n	// load using HTTP\r\n    proxy: new Ext.data.HttpProxy({url: \'http://cc.mytestserver.loc/jTesting/xmlSqlTest.cfm\'}),\r\n\r\n	// the return will be XML, so lets set up a reader\r\n    reader: new Ext.data.XmlReader({\r\n		// records will have an \"T4\" tag\r\n		record: \'T4\',\r\n		id: \'ID\',\r\n		totalRecords: \"recCount\"\r\n	}, [\r\n		// set up the fields mapping into the xml doc\r\n		\'vcFirstName\', \'vcLastName\', \'bIsAdministrator\',\'bIsActive\',\'tsDateLastLogin\'\r\n	]),\r\n\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOk, here is where I have to put on the breaks for a minute. You have to understand a little about what the reader requires here. It helps if you take a look at a return recordset from your service script. I suggest you call it in Firefox for a nice representation, but basically it looks something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<userList>\r\n	<T4>\r\n		<recCount>5802</recCount>\r\n		<ID>2350</ID>\r\n		<vcFirstName>Robin</vcFirstName>\r\n		<vcLastName>Williams</vcLastName>\r\n		<bIsAdministrator>0</bIsAdministrator>\r\n		<bIsActive>1</bIsActive>\r\n		<tsDateLastLogin>2007-05-01T14:34:57</tsDateLastLogin>\r\n	</T4>\r\n	<T4>\r\n		<recCount>5802</recCount>\r\n		<ID>4027</ID>\r\n		<vcFirstName>Howie</vcFirstName>\r\n		<vcLastName>Mandel</vcLastName>\r\n		<bIsAdministrator>0</bIsAdministrator>\r\n		<bIsActive>1</bIsActive>\r\n		<tsDateLastLogin>2007-04-29T16:29:33</tsDateLastLogin>\r\n	</T4>\r\n	...\r\n</userList>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nYou see, looking at the XML, that each record is denoted by the \'T4\' node, which we have mapped in our reader to the \'record\' attribute. You\'ll also note that the \'id\' attribute was mapped to the \'ID\' node in the XML document. This is a unique identifier within each record. We mapped \'totalRecords\' to the \'recCount\' node, as this is where we set up in our script to place the total record count, and then you see a basic comma delimited list of the nodes that will be included in our DataGrid.\r\n\r\nIt\'s important to note here that we have used a very basic XML return for our example here. You do have the power to map values from XML attributes and nested nodes, through the use of XPath syntax. You can even rename a \'field\' when identifying a mapping. Look through the examples included in the ExtJS download to get a better idea of what you might be able to do.\r\n\r\nOK, to finish our DataStore definition we\'re going to specify the ability to \'remotely\' sort our data, and set up our default sort column and sort order.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar ds = new Ext.data.Store({\r\n	// load using HTTP\r\n    proxy: new Ext.data.HttpProxy({url: \'http://cc.mytestserver.loc/jTesting/xmlSqlTest.cfm\'}),\r\n\r\n	// the return will be XML, so lets set up a reader\r\n    reader: new Ext.data.XmlReader({\r\n		// records will have an \"T4\" tag\r\n		record: \'T4\',\r\n		id: \'ID\',\r\n		totalRecords: \"recCount\"\r\n	}, [\r\n		// set up the fields mapping into the xml doc\r\n		\'vcFirstName\', \'vcLastName\', \'bIsAdministrator\',\'bIsActive\',\'tsDateLastLogin\'\r\n	]),\r\n	// turn on remote sorting\r\n	remoteSort: true\r\n});\r\nds.setDefaultSort(\'vcLastName\', \'desc\');\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd so begins our scripting for creating our DataGrid. The big \"gotchas\" that hit me along the way were the stupid things. Mis-identifying my \'record\' mapping, or missing a trailing comma. Firebug and the JavaScript Console (Firefox) are your friends.\r\n\r\nNext round we\'ll define our ColumnModel. This is how we\'ll define the order of initial column display, define column headings, and really button up the initial details before fine tuning our layout.','2007-05-04 19:11:00',NULL,'My-First-ExtJS-DataGrid-Pt-4-The-Data-Store','cutterbl','Default',1,'D:\\sites\\cutterscrossing.com\\subdomains\\blog\\httpdocs\\enclosures/ExtJS_pt3.zip',4829,'application/unknown',62123,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 ('6EB12D9A-3048-71C2-17033EA351429034','My First ExtJS DataGrid Pt 5: The ColumnModel','OK, we\'re winding down to the end of this tutorial, with only a few key components left. Today we cover the ColumnModel, which is how we manage the initial layout of our ExtJS DataGrid. We\'ve already covered initial setup, our paging query, and defined out DataStore (see related entry links at the bottom of the post).\r\n\r\nFirst things first, let\'s instantiate the ColumnModel\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar cm = new Ext.grid.ColumnModel([{\r\n	// cm is our ColumnModel object\r\n\r\n}]);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext we\'ll define the layout of the first column in our grid\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar cm = new Ext.grid.ColumnModel([{\r\n	id: \'fname\',\r\n	header: \"First Name\",\r\n	dataIndex: \'vcFirstName\',\r\n	width: 120\r\n    }\r\n}]);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlright, pretty basic stuff here. We\'ve placed an <em>\'id\'</em> on this column. This allows you to later reference the column specifically for styling. We didn\'t really mark this one for a particular reason, we just did it to explain. Next we have the <em>\'header\'</em>, which is the text that appears in your column header at the top of your DataGrid. This is then followed by the <em>\'dataIndex\'</em> to define the data column it is mapped to within your DataStore. Lastly we have the <em>\'width\'</em> attribute, which speaks for itself.\r\n\r\nThere are several other possible attributes that are available to you here, most of which are fairly easy to grab from the ExtJS API. We\'ll cover a few more in our next tutorial, but for now we\'ll just complete the layout of the ColumnModel.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar cm = new Ext.grid.ColumnModel([{\r\n	id: \'fname\',\r\n	header: \"First Name\",\r\n	dataIndex: \'vcFirstName\',\r\n	width: 120\r\n    },{\r\n	header: \"Last Name\",\r\n	dataIndex: \'vcLastName\',\r\n	width: 120\r\n	},{\r\n	header: \"Is Admin\",\r\n	dataIndex: \'bIsAdministrator\',\r\n	width: 40\r\n	},{\r\n	header: \"Is Active\",\r\n	dataIndex: \'bIsActive\',\r\n	width: 40\r\n	},{\r\n	id: \'last\',\r\n	header: \"Last Login\",\r\n	dataIndex: \'tsDateLastLogin\',\r\n	width: 150\r\n}]);\r\n// by default columns are sortable\r\n\r\ncm.defaultSortable = true;\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe order you work in will be reflected in your final initial layout. Each column definition is contained in curly braces, separated by commas. Each attribute is also comma delimited, with the attribute name being un-quoted, while their values are quoted if string values and not if numeric. Also notice the double quotes around the <em>\'header\'</em> values, but the single quotes around the others. I don\'t know if this is intentional, and haven\'t really tested it, but this is the way it was in all of the example files so I thought it best to stick with the convention. The last thing we did here was set a directive on the ColumnModel to state the the columns will be sortable by default.\r\n\r\nAlright, now you have defined your ColumnModel. A few steps left to go just yet, like the grid itself, custom renderers, styles, and other things to give it a little more cowbell. We\'ll begin wrapping those up in our next edition. For those coming to the Nashville CFUG Scorpio Tour presentation tomorrow night I hope you\'ll flag me down and say high.','2007-05-08 22:32:00',NULL,'My-First-ExtJS-DataGrid-Pt-5-The-ColumnModel','cutterbl','Default',1,'D:\\sites\\cutterscrossing.com\\subdomains\\blog\\httpdocs\\enclosures/ExtJS_pt4.zip',4992,'application/unknown',27805,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 ('778F8A36-3048-71C2-173F957A668D2F76','Scorpio Tour Nashville: Final Wrap-up','First, I want to thank Ben for an outstanding presentation last night. 49 attendees from three different states, from beginners to long time gurus, and everyone walked away highly impressed with the upcoming Scorpio release. (Side Note: Of all of the companies represented it looks like EVERYBODY is hiring).\r\n\r\nBen started off with a minor history of CF. The came the disclaimer: stuff changes. Features shown might change, or not end up in the final version. At the end of it all we asked him what he thought might not make it in and he said, in his current opinion, there was nothing shown that he didn\'t think would make it to final release.\r\n\r\nWhat\'s it all about? In past releases there were typically single points of focus as to why an upgrade was compelling. Scorpio? No single highlight: Developer Productivity, Integration, and Improved Management and Administration.\r\n\r\n<h2>Developer Productivity:</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>CFImage (50 + functions) VERY COOL! Write direct to the browser (I never did that with Alagad). I asked about the underpinnings and image quality concerns. CFImage is built on JAI, but extended by Adobe extensively where needed. Much better quality.</li>\r\n	<li>AJAX - JSON (and serialization), Controls, and wizard.\r\n		<ul>\r\n			<li>autosuggest, populated by a simple list or via an AJAX call back to the server.</li>\r\n			<li>datefield</li>\r\n			<li>richtexteditor - Configurable, to a point. This uses FCKEditor. Works in all visual browsers, with the exception of Safari (which they are working to correct). Does not have the file upload stuff. It\'s been turned off be default (for obvious security reasons) and would require you to edit the server side files. Or, you roll your own (better choice). You can control some base menus, and if you have access you can define your own menus by editing/extending the underlying js.</li>\r\n			<li>DataGrid (more in a minute)</li>\r\n			<li>CFWindow - modal type windows</li>\r\n			<li>cflayout</li>\r\n			<li>cflayoutarea</li>\r\n			<li>related selects - make selects related as many levels as you need, or related to an input box, or related to...</li>\r\n			<li>cfmenu/cfmenuitem - create heirarchal menus simply and easily</li>\r\n			<li>cfajaxproxy? Set up proxies for ajax calls</li>\r\n			<li>cfajaximport - I asked about this. Ben skirted it like we didn\'t see it. Apparently Dave Schuck and the Scots UG noticed it as well (Google the tag)</li>\r\n			<li>New AJAX wizards plugin for Eclipse (query builder wizard included in one example)</li>\r\n			<li>Debugger for AJAX calls (log4javascript?) - turn it on in admin, append a querystring var and it\'s there</li>\r\n		</ul>\r\n		Showed a nice sample app from Ray that uses AJAX to pull traffic problem data, with map, from a zip code. 43 lines of code. I don\'t think <a href=\"http://ray.camdenfamily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray</a> had to write much html in it at all, most generated by the various cf tags. Every \'AJAX\' tag that I saw, except the text editor and maybe the autosuggest, was rendered by Slocum\'s <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ext UI library</a>, and there will be API\'s to show you how to extend the components, as well as the ability to define custom styles.\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>Use cfloop file=\"\" to loop a file line by line - java line reader under the hood</li>\r\n	<li>File I/O functions (so file i/o in cfscript)</li>\r\n	<li>CFThread - Run, Join, Sleep, Terminate.

Some of us want it now. Some of us want more \"Java flavored Scorpio M & M\'s\" All I can say is that Scorpio definitely has more cowbell. We are cookin\' with Crisco baby, and we\'re servin\' it hot! Ben told us that some benchmarks, on certain features, are clocking at 4 to 5 times faster. This is partly due to the JVM advancements within 1.6, and partly due to some reworking by the Adobe engineering team. A lot of attention was given to CFImage to extend the capabilities of the Java Advanced Imaging library to attempt to give things the quality you come to expect from Adobe\'s imaging efforts.

Last tutorial (see the bottom of this post for a complete listing) we covered the initial setup of our ColumnModel, which is telling our DataGrid what the basic layout of our grid columns will be and to which fields of our DataStore each column will be mapped to. Now it\'s time to actually instantiate our grid.\r\n\r\nSo, the first thing we have to do is create our Grid object and tell it which html element will be our grid within our page. Basically we\'ll tell the function the ID of the div element, what DataStore object to use, and which ColumnModel object to use.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n// create the editor grid\r\nvar grid = new Ext.grid.Grid(\'topic-grid\', {\r\n    ds: ds,\r\n    cm: cm\r\n    });\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis is it in it\'s most basic form. We\'re going to stay away from any fancy stuff for now, and get to selection models and stuff in a later post. Let\'s add to it a little bit by stating that the grid may be resizable.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n// make the grid resizable, do before render for better performance\r\nvar rz = new Ext.Resizable(\'topic-grid\', {\r\n	wrap:true,\r\n	minHeight:100,\r\n	pinned:true,\r\n	handles: \'s\'\r\n});\r\nrz.on(\'resize\', grid.autoSize, grid);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThat will make the grid resizable, and should be declared prior to rendering the grid. Rendering the grid is our next step, and way simple.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n// render it\r\ngrid.render();\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nCan\'t get much easier than that. Going back to the resizable for a second, don\'t ask, I don\'t know. Easiest one for me to figure on sight is the minHeight attribute, but I haven\'t reviewed the API enough to know what all is going on. If you figure it out before I do then leave a comment. Next we\'ll need to add the paging tool bar to the footer. We\'ll get the footer, then add the paging toolbar.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar gridFoot = grid.getView().getFooterPanel(true);\r\n\r\n// add a paging toolbar to the grid\'s footer\r\nvar paging = new Ext.PagingToolbar(gridFoot, ds, {\r\n    pageSize: 25,\r\n    displayInfo: true,\r\n    displayMsg: \'Displaying users {0} - {1} of {2}\',\r\n    emptyMsg: \"No users to display\"\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice the arguments of the PagingToolbar() function, the footer object, the DataStore object, and a JSON object with attributes of the pageSize (number of records), whether to display data set info, the message of the count, and a message to display should no records be returned.\r\n\r\nThe final step here is to load the DataStore. Once this is done you will have a complete, basic DataGrid for display.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n// trigger the data store load\r\nds.load({params:{start: 0, limit: 25}});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice here the \'params\'. These are name/value pairs that are passed, via post, whenever you request the next page of your data, with these values being your initial request (starting at row 0, returning 25 records). If you go back and look at your pagingService.cfm (included in the download) you\'ll see where these values are used.\r\n\r\nSo, that\'s the end of this post. You now have a basic DataGrid. In our next tutorial we\'ll start to style some things, and show you how to implement a custom \'renderer\' for a specific column\'s data.','2007-05-26 20:52:00',NULL,'My-First-ExtJS-DataGrid-Pt-6-The-Grid','cutterbl','Default',1,'D:\\sites\\cutterscrossing.com\\subdomains\\blog\\httpdocs\\enclosures/ExtJS_pt5.zip',5578,'application/zip',30318,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 ('D05A5D4C-3048-71C2-1735BA3A01B7969C','The 91st Indianapolis 500','Wow! Ok, I\'m not a big race fan. Races have two real moments of big excitement, the start and the finish. Other than the occasional wreck it\'s a bunch of cars going around in circles. Well, that\'s how I thought.','2007-05-27 21:16:00','But it\'s not <em>just</em> a race, it\'s the Indy 500. It\'s an event. It\'s 400,000 people in the stands, watching one of the largest car races on American soil.\r\n\r\nFor my stepfather this was number 42. Since 1966 he has only missed three races (the college years). Going to the race with him gave me an interesting perspective to tap into, because he is an avid Indy fan, knows the track, and has been here enough times to know how it all works.\r\n\r\nWe had perfect seats, right across from Danica Patrick\'s pit. We were high enough up that we could see over the box seats on the other side of the track, far enough down (to the right of the flag) to have a perfect view from turn four all the way down through turn one, with the ability to see both turn two and turn three in the distance. See, if you\'re behind the flag then the tower blocks your view of the other side of the track. If you\'re too low then the box seats behind the pits will block your view. No, we were in a great spot.\r\n\r\nWe got in nice and early, so we went through the tunnel to the inside of the track to walk around the garages and do a little star gazing. Although, the only star we saw was Rupert of Survivor fame, and a couple of front runners for the NBA draft.\r\n\r\nWe came back around, found our seats, picked up a hot dog and a coke, and settled in for the pre-race activities. Daughtry performed live (I wasn\'t impressed), the cars started to come out. Then they opened up the pit to those with pit passes. David Letterman is part owner of a team, whose driver\'s pit was right behind Danica. He was out hamming it up. \r\n\r\nThey began their celebrity parade, a long line of Corvettes with celebs waving from the back. I recognized The Commodores and a few others.\r\n\r\nThen Chevrolet pulled a bunch of Silverado\'s on the track, with two to three servicemembers in the back of each, waving to the crowd. No one forgot what weekend this was, and the military received the royal treatment (as they should).\r\n\r\nAfter that they pulled the cars from the pit to the line, and the pit crowd migrated with them. The drivers began to come out then. Danica had a huge press corp in tow, and we watched Ashley Judd kiss her husband Dario (the eventual race winner) good luck prior to him getting in his car.\r\n\r\nA huge joint services procession marched down pit row, stopping in front of the grandstand for Florence Henderson singing \'God Bless America\', which is a long standing tradition. The National Anthem played, and some of us remembered to sing along with the joint services choir (I\'m embarrassed when others don\'t stand, sing, and put their hand over their heart).\r\n\r\nThe fateful words, \'Ladies and Gentlemen, Start Your Engines\', began the roar. This is when I put on the headphones that John had preprogrammed to all of the driver\'s frequencies. The noise is deafening, and very exciting. Patrick Dempsey, who is part owner of the Vision racing team, drove the pace car to start the cars around the track, and Peyton Manning waved the green flag to truly start the race.\r\n\r\nThree women drivers qualified to race this year. Milka Duno, the rookie from Venezuala with four masters degrees, crashed out around lap 103. Danica went from the 20th position after the third caution to 3rd position at the fourth caution, and finishing 8th overall. Sarah Fischer came from last place (33rd) to finish 18th overall.\r\n\r\nThe race was delayed after lap 113. A heavy storm came in, putting a halt to everything. John listened to the weather and found out that they were expecting it to rain for 45 minutes, which would require two and a half hours to dry the track afterwards. Knowing that the race wouldn\'t resume until 6pm (if it resumed) we decided to pack it up and head back to Dayton. In John\'s experience it was very possible that another storm could come through before the track was dried, which would end the race. If the race resumed (which it did) we wouldn\'t get back to Dayton til nearly midnight, so it was time to head out. We weren\'t alone.\r\n\r\nJust after six the race did resume, with us listening on the radio while just pulling into the outskirts of Dayton in the pouring rain. They did get another 53 laps in before the rain began again, finally ending the race. Dario Franchitti, husband of Ashley Judd, won the race.\r\n\r\nDuring the first part of the race we saw the lead position change at least 12 times. Every caution came off of turn one, to which we had a fantastic view for most every one. With Danica\'s pit directly across from us I spent a lot of time tuned into their frequency on the scanner. Very impressive how well they communicate and coordinate, at one point with her gaining five positions by coming into the pit for gas and tires. The stretch between turn four and turn one, and at the beginning of turn one, was where you saw all of the power players really competing for position.\r\n\r\nListening to the rest of the race, the biggest event we missed was 20 year old Marco Andretti flipping his car. Thankfully he walked away from it, as did every driver today who took a hard turn. By the way, there were three Andretti\'s racing today, Marco, Michael, and John.\r\n\r\nSo, a very exciting time. While writing this I\'ve pulled up all of the stats on <a href=\"http://www.indycar.com\" target=\"_blank\">IndyCar.com</a>, which is dragging incredibly slow (should have used ColdFusion instead of PHP;), but is otherwise pretty well done. My one big downside is that I found out how badly I need a better digital camera, as the digital zoom really degraded the image quality of most of the shots I took (nothing fit for publication).\r\n\r\nNow, about next year....','The-91st-Indianapolis-500','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',3760,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

The trick here is the complexity of our setup. We have multiple sites, sharing the same code base, accessing media from external resources. We also have to setup for multi-instance, to separate our front-end sites and our back-end administration. We also need to be setup for one SSL site. Oh yeah, and we have to do it on Apache, since XP pro\'s version of IIS has some limitations about running multiple domains simultaneously. To top it all off (at least in my case) I also have to run Apache 2.0.59 so that I can also run Subversion, which is not yet compatible with Apache 2.2.','2007-06-08 17:48:00','Initial setup of Apache with ColdFusion (7 or 8) is fairly straightforward by following AcidLabs <a href=\"http://blog.acidlabs.org/2006/10/25/the-acme-guide-new-location/\" target=\"_blank\">ACME Guide</a>. Follow the instructions for setup carefully, paying attention to the installation options, as it will be very important towards your setup success. In my case I did use the <a href=\"http://apache.cs.utah.edu/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.59-win32-x86-no_ssl.msi\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0.59 Win32 Binary (MSI Installer)</a> version. The true fun begins when it\'s time to \'configure\' your server.\r\n\r\nFirst, some basics on your Apache setup. I used the same naming convention for the server name as my machine name: username.companyname.loc. This means that, when I call the URL later on, http://username.companyname.loc, I should be able to see content if I have configured everything correctly. The ColdFusion installer handles the majority of the basic setup with Apache. But I wanted to access my CFIDE from the domain, and I wanted to have that domain (username.companyname.loc) to direct to a specific folder which I use for scratchpad-type-playaround-files. The first thing you must do is setup, within your httpd.conf file, to allow for named Virtual hosts. Then I needed to setup a VirtualHost entry within my httpd.conf.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#\r\n# Use name-based virtual hosting.\r\n#\r\nNameVirtualHost *:80\r\n\r\n	....\r\n\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	# Root folder for my scratchpad stuff\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\CFTest\"\r\n	ServerName username.companyname.loc\r\n	# Alias for /CFIDE, which the CF install placed in my Apache webroot.\r\n	# This is solely for our dev environment, and would not be a good practice\r\n	# within a production environment\r\n	Alias /CFIDE \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\"\r\n	<Directory \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\">\r\n		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI\r\n		AllowOverride All\r\n		Order allow,deny\r\n		Allow from all\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	ErrorLog logs/username.companyname.loc-error_log\r\n	CustomLog logs/username.companyname.loc-access_log common\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis allowed me to place an index.cfm file inside my <em>CFTest</em> directory, hit it from the browser, http://username.companyname.loc, and get a valid response. Next step was to get a copy of our codebase and place it locally. I placed a \'compweb\' folder within <em>My Documents</em>, then place all of the code within it, similar to Microsoft\'s <em>InetPub</em> folder concept. Then I wrote a new VirtualHost directive for one of our dev sites.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# dev1 setup\r\n<VirtualHost dev1.companyname.loc:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\\V2\"\r\n	ServerName dev1.companyname.loc\r\n	ErrorLog logs/dev1.companyname.loc-error_log\r\n	CustomLog logs/dev1.companyname.loc-access_log common\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSo, by now directing my local host file to serv dev1.companyname.loc directly from 127.0.0.1, when I hit the URL, http://dev1.companyname.loc, I begin to see the content of dev1. Well, almost. Now we come upon the next challenge, our remote resource access.\r\n\r\nLike our production environment, our development environments will now access media from a remote location via a UNC path. You have to use a UNC path because Apache will not allow you to map a drive letter (it\'ll crash Apache). What took me a while to figure out was that you can not use Apache to control the directory access, you must do this through the user account access. You <strong>can not</strong> use the <em>Directory</em> Apache directives for access control. This also means that your Apache instance must run as the user who has access to the remote resource (I also setup CF instance to run as the same user.)\r\n\r\nI also discovered something else the hard way, Apache Aliases are case-specific. This means that you have to use double Aliases for each virtual directory that you define via an Alias.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# dev1 setup\r\n<VirtualHost dev1.companyname.loc:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\\V2\"\r\n	ServerName dev1.companyname.loc\r\n	Alias /V2WebRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\"\r\n	Alias /v2webroot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\"\r\n	Alias /Images/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Images/\r\n\r\n	Alias /images/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Images/\r\n\r\n	Alias /Media/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Media/\r\n\r\n	Alias /media/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Media/\r\n\r\n	Alias /SiteSpecific/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/SiteSpecific/\r\n\r\n	Alias /sitespecific/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/SiteSpecific/\r\n\r\n	Alias /Theme/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Theme/\r\n\r\n	Alias /theme/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Theme/\r\n\r\n	Alias /VendorInventory/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/VendorInventory/\r\n\r\n	Alias /vendorinventory/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/VendorInventory/\r\n\r\n	ErrorLog logs/dev1.companyname.loc-error_log\r\n	CustomLog logs/dev1.companyname.loc-access_log common\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis now allows all of our remote resource content to come through. Notice, for the moment, that your domain port is still set to port 80. This will change when we configure multiple server instances, but for now it will work to get you up and running. Well, sort of. There\'s still SSL to contend with.\r\n\r\nOK, a lot of trial and error went into getting this part together and working. Most current posts on setting up Apache and SSL will tell you to go download a build with SSL configured and included right through the installer. Well, those are for 2.2, and you already installed Apache anyway. What do you do next?\r\n\r\nFirst, let\'s gather some resources. If you don\'t already have a copy of <a href=\"http://www.winmerge.org\" target=\"_blank\">WinMerge</a> then go get it! You\'re going to need it anyway, so you might as well get it now. Next you\'ll want to go and get a precompiled <a href=\"http://web.apachessl.net/index.php?id=index&lang=en\" target=\"_blank\">ApacheSSL</a> distribution. Since I have to use Apache 2.0.59 for Subversion integration then I will use the <a href=\"http://web.apachessl.net/download.php?DownloadVersion=ApacheSSL_2.0.59-OpenSSL_0.9.8e\" target=\"_blank\">ApacheSSL 2.0.59 - OpenSSL 0.9.8e</a> distro. Go ahead and install WinMerge, then unzip the ApacheSSL distro to a folder on your desktop.\r\n\r\nYou can easily find pre-compiled distros of Apache 2.2 with SSL enabled, with full installers. So, if you don\'t require Subversion integration (i.e.: you aren\'t hosting your own repositories locally), then by all means use it from the get go and skip all of this \'fun.\' But, if you are going to host your own repositories, like versioning your own personal files, etc., then you\'ll have to take this route.\r\n\r\nFirst you\'ll want to do a directory comparison of the ApacheSSL download and your current Apache installation (I installed mine to C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Apache2). If you limit your results, through the \'View\' menu, to only those files that are different or only resident in the ApacheSSL folder then you will see quite a few files that need to be updated within your Apache folder. First, stop your Apache server. Carefully go through the list to find the files that you can \'Copy Right to Left\' (this is a right click menu command, and assumes that the ApacheSSL folder is your \'right\' and your Apache folder is your \'left\'.) Most of these are your <em>.so</em> files, your compiled modules, that are in your <em>/bin/iconv</em> folder or your <em>/modules</em> folder. You\'ll notice that those files in your Apache folder are dated some time in 2006, but the ApacheSSL files are dated 2/24/2007. You will also find several items in the ApacheSSL folder that are not in your Apache folder, primarily binaries that you need and should copy over.\r\n\r\nThe last items, and the ones you need to be most careful about, are the non-binary files that are different. These are primarily the <em>.conf</em> files in your <em>/conf</em> folder. You don\'t want to overwrite your existing files, as that will wipe out all of the changes that were made to accomodate JRun and CF. For the moment you can leave the httpd.conf file alone, just make sure you copy over the ssl.conf (any other non-binary files can be left as is).\r\n\r\nOK, now that you\'re \'synced up\' you can begin the steps necessary to enable SSL configuration. This is for your securetest.companyname.loc site. The first thing you need to do is copy the <em>ssleay32.dll</em> and <em>lebeay32.dll</em> files from your <em>Apache2\\bin</em> folder into your <em>Windows\\System32</em> folder. Make sure you copy the .dll files and not the .lib files. Now you\'re ready to create your personal security certificates.\r\n\r\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to your <em>Apache2\\bin</em> folder. Once there you can begin to use the openssl executable to create your certs. Although you will need one for each secure site you configure, you need to start by creating one for your root server: username.companyname.loc. To start you will need to execute the following command in your console.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nopenssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -out username.csr\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe .csr file can have any name, but I\'ve named it like this so I know that it\'s associated with my root server domain. Here is a step by step of what you should see, with my responses bracketed by percentage signs.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nLoading \'screen\' into random state - done\r\nGenerating a 1024 bit RSA private key\r\n........++++++\r\n.......++++++\r\nwriting new private key to \'privkey.pem\'\r\nEnter PEM pass phrase: %my-made-up-pass%\r\nVerifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: %my-made-up-pass%\r\n-----\r\nYou are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.\r\nWhat you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\r\nThere are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\r\nFor some fields there will be a default value,\r\nIf you enter \'.\', the field will be left blank.\r\n-----\r\nCountry Name (2 letter code) []:%US%\r\nState or Province Name (full name) []:%mystate%\r\nLocality Name (eg, city) []:%mycity%\r\nOrganization Name (eg, company) []:%companyname%\r\nOrganizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:%mydept%\r\nCommon Name (eg, your websites domain name) []:%username.companyname.loc%\r\nEmail Address []:%username@companyname.com%\r\n\r\nPlease enter the following \'extra\' attributes\r\nto be sent with your certificate request\r\nA challenge password []:%my-made-up-pass%\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis will create the <em>.csr</em> file. Now, on to the next step, the private key file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nopenssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out username.key\r\nEnter pass phrase for privkey.pem:%my-made-up-pass%\r\nwriting RSA key\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOk, now that we have a private key all that\'s left is to get a certificate.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nopenssl x509 -in username.csr -out username.cert -req -signkey username.key -days 365\r\nLoading \'screen\' into random state - done\r\nSignature OK\r\nsubject=/C=US/ST=mystate/L=mycity/O=companyname/OU=mydept/CN=username.companyname.loc/emailAddress=username@companyname.com\r\nGetting Private key\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlright, now you have your certificate for your root server. Create, within your <em>Apach2\\conf</em> folder, two new folders <em>ssl.cert</em> and <em>ssl.key</em>, and move your <em>username.cert</em> and <em>username.key</em> files in their respective folders. You may also delete the <em>.rnd</em> file from your <em>Apache2\\bin</em> folder. This file contains entropy information for creating the key and could be used for cryptographic attacks against your private key. Although this isn\'t likely within your local development environment, it is still good practice.\r\n\r\nAs this is for your local environment this is a simple way of creating a self-signed certificate for development use. All you have to do is install the certificate in your browser the first time you come to a secure page. Also note that this certificate expires after a year, and you can increase the <em>-days 365</em> if you want.\r\n\r\nNow we start getting into actually configuring your server for your SSL connection. First you will want to remove the comment hash (#) from the LoadModule line for <em>ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so</em>. This is generally the last line of the LoadModule descriptors in your <em>httpd.conf</em> file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# SGB: Enabling SSL\r\nLoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext you\'ll find the IfModule block below:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\r\n	Include conf/ssl.conf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd add a few necessary lines:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\r\n	Include conf/ssl.conf\r\n</IfModule>\r\nSSLMutex default\r\nSSLRandomSeed startup builtin\r\nSSLSessionCache none\r\nErrorLog logs/ssl.log\r\nLogLevel info\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe next step took a great deal of trial and error to get straight. First, make a backup copy of the <em>ssl.conf</em> file. Then, within the original file, we\'re going to make several changes. First, comment (with a hash sign [#]) the opening and closing IfDefine tags near the top and very bottom of the file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#<IfDefine SSL>\r\n	....\r\n#</IfDefine>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext, remove the entire VirtualHost block from the file. This is loaded with lines and lines of comments, is already in your backup file for later reference, and only confuses what is needed (and caused me errors somewhere anyway). First we\'re going to setup a \'default\' VirtualHost entry for your root server, using the certificate and key you created before.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<VirtualHost username.companyname.loc:443>\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\CFTest\"\r\n	ServerName username.companyname.loc\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	ErrorLog logs/username-ssl-error.log\r\n	TransferLog logs/username-ssl-access.log\r\n	SSLEngine On\r\n	SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL\r\n	SSLCertificateFile conf/ssl.cert/username.cert\r\n	SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/ssl.key/username.key\r\n	<FilesMatch \"\\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|cfm|cfc|php3?)$\">\r\n		SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\r\n	</FilesMatch>\r\n	<Directory \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\CFTest\">\r\n		SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	SetEnvIf User-Agent \".*MSIE.*\" \\\r\n			 nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\r\n			 downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\r\n	CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \\\r\n			  \"%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \\\"%r\\\" %b\"\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nYou can now do some minor testing. Restart your Apache server. Go to the ApacheSSL folder you still have on your desktop, into the <em>ApacheSSL\\htdocs</em> folder, and copy the three files into the document root above (<em>C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\CFTest</em>). If you go to <em>https://username.companyname.loc/index.html</em> in your browser you should get an alert to accept your self-signed certificate, and see page from <em>The Apache SSL</em> project, as well as the lock in the bottom right of your browser\'s status bar.\r\n\r\nOk, so now you\'ve setup Apache for SSL, to a degree. Now let\'s setup another VirtualHost for our secure test server for our sites. Create a new self-signed certificate, using the steps above, for the server <em>securetest.companyname.loc</em>, using different file naming so that it is unique to the domain name. It is extremely important that you use the correct domain name, matching it exactly to the domain name you will use, otherwise the browser will scream about security issues with your certificate.

 ('FF318BAB-3048-71C2-17E1634637074ECF','The ColdFusion 8 AJAX Components Debate','A debate rages on across the ColdFusion development community about the inclusion, and use, of the AJAX driven components and accompanying tags that have been included in the Beta Release of <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion8/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 8</a>. Many examples of their use and benefit have already been posted by the likes of <a href=\"ray.camdenfamily.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Camden</a>, <a href=\"http://www.kinkysolutions.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Nadel</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.forta.com/blog\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Forta</a>. No surprise there, as they all are huge proponents of the product, and, like so many of us, are very excited about the upcoming release of our favorite web programming platform.\r\n\r\nBut there are others still that think that the inclusion of these tags and components don\'t necessarily belong in the core language set of CFML. Many of these folks are also diehard JavaScripters, who took up writing AJAX early in it\'s infancy, fashioned their own components, or even contribute to open source libraries like <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a>. They argue that maybe the tags should have been separate CFCs available through the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/exchange/\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Developer\'s Exchange</a>, or that the JavaScript rendered by the ColdFusion engine is too fat, taking up unnecessary bandwidth.\r\n\r\nCan\'t we all just get along?','2007-06-05 23:51:00','I, too, love many of these third party JavaScript libraries. I am a huge proponent of <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a>, including it by default in every project. Currently I am <a href=\"/index.cfm/My-First-ExtJS-DataGrid\" target=\"_blank\">running a multi-part tutorial on creating a paging DataGrid</a> using Jack Slocum\'s <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS UI</a> library. I think that using these libraries, or others like them, is the smart thing to do. Not having to reinvent the wheel. Giving developers the ability to create sharp, interactive, and creative user experiences. And I got very excited when I saw that Adobe had created tags for implementing components like these, using the <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS UI</a> library for the majority of the components.\r\n\r\n\"But the scripts are too fat! Why aren\'t they compressed? They\'re to big! They take up so much space and bandwidth!\" Yes, they do. But I think some people are missing the point as well.\r\n\r\nWhen was the last time you used cfform? Many experienced developers stopped using it years ago, instead rolling their own JavaScript client side validation and ColdFusion server side validation. Rolling our own gave us more control, and allowed us to get more creative, writing our own custom controls (or using someone else\'s). Some of us learned what to do, and what not to do, by reading through the Macromedia included scripts. The point was, we could use it if we wanted. Have a quick project with no budget? Use cfform instead of writing your own validation. Saves you some time. Quickly prototyping an application for a client? Use cfform. Give them enough to say \"I like it, but I want it to do this too,\" and get them to pony up the dough to spend the time to write it right.\r\n\r\nColdFusion is the language for \"Making the hard things easy.\" The primary focus hasn\'t changed, it\'s just gotten an overdue facelift. The same arguments still apply. Ultra-newbie wannabe developers, writing their first site for Ma and Pa\'s Kountry Kettle, can create a more feature rich site, and user experience, with minimal learning curve. More experienced developers can create quick prototype applications to gain further approval for time and funding approval, or keep it simple to keep it in budget. \r\n\r\nShould Adobe compress all of these scripts prior to the final release of <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion8/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 8</a>? Sure they should, and I\'d  be surprised if they weren\'t listening very carefully right now to all of the feedback coming in on the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/webforums/forum/categories.cfm?forumid=72&catid=648&entercat=y\" target=\"_blank\">Labs Forums</a>. The bandwidth debate rages on, even as connections are getting faster and faster, but there are people still using dial-up connections. But that shouldn\'t keep these components and tags from being included in the core language set. They are a welcome addition, and benefit every developer, no matter what level, in the robustness of the feature set they offer, and the ability to do what no other server-side engine can currently do out-of-the-box. \r\n\r\nSo, to those who feel the need to debate, <strong>kwitcherbellyakin</strong>! Just because the tags and components are there doesn\'t mean you <em>have</em> to use them, it just means you <em>should</em> in the right situation.\r\n\r\n<strong>ColdFusion 8. Use It. Love It.

You can create instances in three different ways, via command line, through the JRun admin interface, or through the ColdFusion Administrator of the instance originally created when you did your multi-instance install (this is the same in CF 7 or 8). Note: This option will not be available if, during install, you did not select the \"J2EE configuration (ColdFusion MX with JRun4)\" installation option.','2007-06-08 15:06:00','Let\'s take a quick moment to talk about the ColdFusion web server connector though. The <em>Web Server Configuration Tool</em>, within your programs menu for ColdFusion, shows you what web server is set to run with ColdFusion. Multiple instances of CF on top of IIS are very easily configured here, but you only have one config file with Apache so the setup is a little different, requiring a great deal more manual configuration. Under a typical IIS installation, the Web Server Configuration Tool would create consecutively numbered new folders under your <em>C:\\JRun4\\lib\\wsconfig\\</em> folder. During your initial install, the setup of your default (CFusion) instance created the folder <em>1</em>. For your Apache setup you will need to manually create the empty instance folders, in this case named the same as your instances. Under <em>C:\\JRun4\\lib\\wsconfig\\</em>, create two folders, \"Sites\" and \"Control\".\r\n\r\nWhen looking at your Microsoft Management Console, under Services, you will find 2 separate instances of Macromedia JRun (this is confusing, as it\'s the same on ColdFusion 8, whereas any new instances will be \"Adobe ColdFusion 8 AS x\"). One is the \"Admin\" instance, and one the \"CFusion\" instance (ColdFusion 8 also includes a \"samples\" instance in the Enterprise Manager, but it is off by default and not in your MMC). Most of the time your \"Admin\" instance can be stopped, as this is the instance that runs the JRun Administrator. If you wanted to, you could create additional instance from within the JRun Administrator, http://localhost:8000/ in most cases. Username = admin pw= whatever you set as your cf admin. For our purposes, though, we\'re going to use the ColdFusion Administrator on our default (CFusion) instance. In your administrator, http://username.companyname.loc/CFIDE/Administrator at this point, go to the item marked <em>Enterprise Manager</em> at the bottom of your navigation and select the <em>Instance Manager</em> menu item.\r\n\r\nUsing the ColdFusion Adminstrator of your default instance, within the navigation go to the <strong>Enterprise Manager</strong> section (at the bottom) and select the <strong>Instance Manager</strong> option. Here you will be able to <em>Add New Instance</em>, which asks for a unique \"Server Name\", \"Server Directory\", and some optional arguments. Set your first \"Server Name\" to <strong>Sites</strong>, while defining your \"Server Directory\" to <strong>C:\\JRun4/servers/Sites</strong>, and finally selecting the \"Create Windows Service\" option. Hit submit and you\'re off to a start. Within your Microsoft Management Console, under Services, stop this new instance and setup, through it\'s properties, so that it will run as the correct user (as above). Open the file C:\\JRun4\\servers\\Sites\\SERVER-INF\\jrun.xml, and find the lines starting with the following code:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<service class=\"jrun.servlet.jrpp.JRunProxyService\" name=\"ProxyService\">\r\n	<attribute name=\"activeHandlerThreads\">25</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"backlog\">500</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"deactivated\">false</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"interface\">*</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"maxHandlerThreads\">1000</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"minHandlerThreads\">1</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"port\">51002</attribute>\r\n	....\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nFirst, make sure that <em>deactivated</em> is set to <strong>false</strong>. Next, write down the <em>port</em> value (in the above example it is 51002). Check these values in your default (CFusion) server as well. OK, now we will go into the <em>httpd.conf</em> for your Apache server. Find the following (or similar) block of code:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# JRun Settings\r\nLoadModule jrun_module \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so\"\r\n<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n	JRunConfig Verbose false\r\n	JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n	JRunConfig Ssl false\r\n	JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n	JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/jrunserver.store\"\r\n	JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51000\r\n	#JRunConfig Errorurl <optionally redirect to this URL on errors>\r\n	#JRunConfig ProxyRetryInterval <number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to unreachable clustered server>\r\n	#JRunConfig ConnectTimeout 15\r\n	#JRunConfig RecvTimeout 300\r\n	#JRunConfig SendTimeout 15\r\n	AddHandler jrun-handler .jsp .jws .cfm .cfml .cfc .cfr .cfswf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd truncate it like so:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# JRun Settings\r\nLoadModule jrun_module \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so\"\r\n<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n	JRunConfig Verbose false\r\n	JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n	JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n	AddHandler jrun-handler .jsp .jws .cfm .cfml .cfc .cfr .cfswf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nYou can comment out the additional lines if you prefer. Next we\'ll ensure that we can still get to the default (CFusion) instances ColdFusion administrator by adjusting the VirtualHosts directive for our default server:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<VirtualHost username.companyname.loc:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	# Root folder for my scratchpad stuff\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\CFTest\"\r\n	ServerName username.companyname.loc\r\n	# Alias for /CFIDE, which the CF install placed in my Apache webroot.\r\n	# This is solely for our dev environment, and would not be a good practice\r\n	# within a production environment\r\n	Alias /CFIDE \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\"\r\n	<Directory \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\">\r\n		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI\r\n		AllowOverride All\r\n		Order allow,deny\r\n		Allow from all\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	ErrorLog logs/username.companyname.loc-error_log\r\n	CustomLog logs/username.companyname.loc-access_log common\r\n	# Set the instance for this domain to our \'default\' (CFusion) instance\r\n	<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n		JRunConfig Verbose true\r\n		#JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n		JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n		JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/jrunserver.store\"\r\n		JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51000\r\n	</IfModule>\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSetup a new VirtualHosts directive to accomodate the ColdFusion Administrator for your new \"Sites\" instance, directing to a new domain (don\'t forget your hosts file), using the JRun port you wrote down for that instance (51002).\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<VirtualHost Sites.companyname.loc:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	ServerName Sites.companyname.loc\r\n	# Alias for /CFIDE, which the CF install placed in my Apache webroot.\r\n	# This is solely for our dev environment, and would not be a good practice\r\n	# within a production environment\r\n	Alias /CFIDE \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\"\r\n	<Directory \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\">\r\n		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI\r\n		AllowOverride All\r\n		Order allow,deny\r\n		Allow from all\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	ErrorLog logs/Sites.companyname.loc-error_log\r\n	CustomLog logs/Sites.companyname.loc-access_log common\r\n	# Set the instance for this domain to our \'Sites\' instance\r\n	<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n		JRunConfig Verbose true\r\n		#JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n		JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n		JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/Sites/jrunserver.store\"\r\n		JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51002\r\n	</IfModule>\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow, if you go to http://Sites.companyname.loc/CFIDE/Administrator, you can login to the ColdFusion Administrator of your \"Sites\" instance. You will see that <strong>most</strong> settings you may have set in your \"default\" (CFusion) instance have carried over, with the notable exception of your Data Sources, all of which will have to be reconfigured. Also notice that I removed the <em>DocumentRoot</em> attribute, as you won\'t actually access any other folder for this domain. You access your \"default\" (CFusion) instance CF Admin at http://username.companyname.loc/CFIDE/Administrator.\r\n\r\nSince 51002 (in our example) is the JRun port of the \"Sites\" instance, then we apply it to our development sites and securetest site:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# dev1 setup\r\n<VirtualHost dev1.companyname.loc:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\\V2\"\r\n	ServerName dev1.companyname.loc\r\n	Alias /V2WebRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\"\r\n	Alias /v2webroot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\compweb\\wwwroot\"\r\n	Alias /Images/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Images/\r\n\r\n	Alias /images/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Images/\r\n\r\n	Alias /Media/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Media/\r\n\r\n	Alias /media/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Media/\r\n\r\n	Alias /SiteSpecific/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/SiteSpecific/\r\n\r\n	Alias /sitespecific/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/SiteSpecific/\r\n\r\n	Alias /Theme/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Theme/\r\n\r\n	Alias /theme/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/Theme/\r\n\r\n	Alias /VendorInventory/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/VendorInventory/\r\n\r\n	Alias /vendorinventory/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/V2/VendorInventory/\r\n\r\n	ErrorLog logs/dev1.companyname.loc-error_log\r\n	CustomLog logs/dev1.companyname.loc-access_log common\r\n	# Set the instance for this domain to our \'Sites\' instance\r\n	<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n		JRunConfig Verbose true\r\n		#JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n		JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n		JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/Sites/jrunserver.store\"\r\n		JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51002\r\n	</IfModule>\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n\r\n...

I went the the \"Build Your Own\" section within \"Downloads\" and built a script for JQuery with the ExtJS Core and the TabPanel. I also downloaded the whole library so that I had all of the example scripts, css, and images. After this I included the following files in my document header (notice the pathing changes):','2007-06-15 18:22:00','<code>\r\n<script src=\"http://www.myserver.com/js/jquery/jquery-1.1.2.pack.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"http://www.myserver.com/js/ext-1.0/ext.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"http://www.myserver.com/js/custom/ExtJSTabsDemo.js\" type=\"text/javascript\"></script>\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://www.myserver.com/resources/css/ext-1.0/tabs.css\" type=\"text/css\">\r\n<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"http://www.myserver.com/resources/css/ext-1.0/tabs-example.css\" type=\"text/css\">\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI also adjusted the pathing of all image references in the css files. Then we add the same div/form code from our prior example, minus the unordered lists.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<div id=\"container\">\r\n	<div id=\"half-frag\">\r\n		<form name=\"section-1\" id=\"section-1\" action=\"process.cfm\" method=\"post\" enctype=\"multipart/form-data\">\r\n			<div id=\"form1_step1\" class=\"frmStep\">\r\n			   Field 1: <input type=\"text\" name=\"field1\" id=\"field1\" />\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div id=\"form1_step2\" class=\"frmStep\">\r\n			   Field 2: <input type=\"text\" name=\"field2\" id=\"field2\" />\r\n			</div>\r\n			<div id=\"form1_step3\" class=\"frmStep\">\r\n			   Field 3: <input type=\"text\" name=\"field3\" id=\"field3\" /><br />\r\n			   <input type=\"submit\" name=\"submit\" id=\"submit\" value=\"Post Form\" />\r\n			</div>\r\n		</form>\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"fragment-1\">\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"fragment-2\">\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n	</div>\r\n	<div id=\"fragment-3\">\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n		Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit, sed diam nonummy nibh euismod tincidunt ut laoreet dolore magna aliquam erat volutpat.\r\n	</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe last thing is building that custom script, ExtJSTabsDemo.js. This is solely for defining your tab sets.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n$(document).ready(function(){\r\n	var tabs1 = new Ext.TabPanel(\'container\');\r\n	tabs1.addTab(\'half-frag\',\'Form 1\');\r\n	tabs1.addTab(\'fragment-1\',\'pg 2\');\r\n	tabs1.addTab(\'fragment-2\',\'pg 3\');\r\n	tabs1.addTab(\'fragment-3\',\'pg 4\');\r\n	\r\n	// Create the nested tab set\r\n	var nTabs1 = new Ext.TabPanel(\'half-frag\');\r\n	nTabs1.addTab(\'form1_step1\',\'Step 1\');\r\n	nTabs1.addTab(\'form1_step2\',\'Step 2\');\r\n	nTabs1.addTab(\'form1_step3\',\'Step 3\');\r\n	// Activate in reverse order\r\n	nTabs1.activate(\'form1_step1\');\r\n	tabs1.activate(\'half-frag\');\r\n	// Set the heights of each tab to be consistent\r\n	// per tab set\r\n	nTabs1.syncHeight(100);\r\n	tabs1.syncHeight(150);\r\n});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice there\'s quite a bit more JS involved here than in our previous example.

This comment header states what the template is, what it is used for, who originally created the file (if known) and a \'revision\' listing. Every time a template is revised a notation was added to this header, with initials and date stamp, as to the purpose of the revision. This didn\'t replace line level comments to explain blocks of code, only augmented the process so that a total document change overview was available in an easy to review location.','2007-06-22 09:56:00','Recently we finally moved to a version control system, Subversion.

But, currently I am in a minor debate with our Development Manager, as well as a few members of our team. They believe that we should no longer use our revision comment system, since Subversion is setup to require a comment on commit. Their argument is that you can easily pull the \'history\' of a document from Subversion.\r\n\r\nBut, like any good team, the issue is open for debate. No one has layed down new policy in stone yet. I asked if I could put the question out to the community-at-large, to get an idea of how others handle this situation and try to learn from the experiences of those who\'ve traveled this road before.

Our office is migrating into an enterprise development team, instituting new (as a team) tools and processes within our development environment. So, upcoming (yes, I\'m committing to this) posts will include topics like setting up multi-instance <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> (7 or 8) on <a href=\"http://www.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a>, using Windows UNC paths in an <a href=\"http://www.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a> VirtualHost configuration, <a href=\"http://www.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a> + SSL (once I get around my JRun errors), and <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Subversion</a> + <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ant</a> for deployment. This should be interesting, as I compiled everything from dozens of blog posts, dev center and trade mag articles, and a ton of trial and error. Stay tuned for that.\r\n\r\nI also wanted to give a big shout out to the <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionweekly.com\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion Weekly Podcast</a>. Catching up the other day I was listening to their 2.20 episode, which reminded me that I should check out <a href=\"http://www.remotesynthesis.com/blog/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Brian Rinaldi</a>\'s <a href=\"http://cfcgenerator.riaforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Illudium PU-36 Code Generator</a>. Brian\'s tool, crafted over years of work and refinement, is a truly class act tool for any developer\'s toolbox. By introspecting your datasource tables, the generator can automagically create a complete set of basic object persistence \'objects\', to include Bean/DAO/Gateway cfc\'s, coldspring config xml, and a lot more. And, it\'s configurable and extendable. Very sweet, and can save hours and hours of tedious repitition.\r\n\r\nAn additional shout to <a href=\"http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.maestropublishing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter</a> for bringing up the <a href=\"http://code.google.com/p/litepost/\" target=\"_blank\">LitePost</a> project (and kudos to <a href=\"http://cdscott.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Scott</a> for his work on the project as well). For anyone diving into Object Oriented CF and frameworks, this little blog project is a great study. The core library of objects and services are written in such a way that they can be used by any of the major frameworks, with the only differences being at the view and controller layers (and their differences are pretty minimal). A must look sample project, and totally undocumented, that you must download from the Subversion repository, reviewing each of the individual layers can really put some pictures together for you.

The trick here is the complexity of our setup. We have multiple sites, sharing the same code base, accessing media from external resources. We also have to setup for multi-instance, to separate our front-end site and our back-end administration. We also need to be setup for one SSL site. Oh yeah, and we have to do it on Apache, since XP pro\'s version of IIS has some limitations about running multiple domains simultaneously. To top it all off (at least in my case) I also have to run Apache 2.0.59 so that I can also run Subversion, which is not yet compatible with Apache 2.2.','2007-07-23 08:00:00','Initial setup of Apache with ColdFusion (7 or 8) is fairly straightforward by following AcidLabs <a href=\"http://blog.acidlabs.org/2006/10/25/the-acme-guide-new-location/\" target=\"_blank\">ACME Guide</a>. Follow the instructions for setup carefully, paying attention to the installation options, as it will be very important towards your setup success. In my case I did use the <a href=\"http://www.pangex.com/pub/apache/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.59-win32-x86-openssl-0.9.7j.msi\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0.59 Win32 SSL Binary (MSI Installer)</a> version. The true fun begins when it\'s time to \'configure\' your server.\r\n\r\nFirst, some basics on your Apache setup. I used the same naming convention for the server name as my machine name: username.companyname.loc. This means that, when I call the URL later on, http://username.companyname.loc, I should be able to see content if I have configured everything correctly. The ColdFusion installer handles the majority of the basic setup with Apache. But I wanted to access my CFIDE from the domain, and I wanted to have that domain (username.companyname.loc) to direct to a specific folder which I use for scratchpad-type-playaround-files. The first thing you must do is setup, within your httpd.conf file, to allow for named Virtual hosts. Find the \"Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support\" area of your Apache configuration file. The LoadModule statements are used to enable, or disable, certain features of the server. In this case, you need to enable the module for Virtual Hosts.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n....\r\n#  SGB: 07.09.07 Enable mods for VirtualHosts and SSL\r\nLoadModule vhost_alias_module modules/mod_vhost_alias.so\r\n....\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext you will need to enable support for NameVirtualHost, and create a virtual host directive for your default administrative server. This is done at the very end of your config file. We\'ll also add an \'Alias\', which is basically a virtual directory, that will point to your CFIDE folder.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#\r\n# Use name-based virtual hosting.\r\n#\r\nNameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80\r\n\r\n	....\r\n\r\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	# Root folder for my scratchpad stuff\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\"\r\n	ServerName username.companyname.loc\r\n	# Alias for /CFIDE, which the CF install placed in my Apache webroot.\r\n	# This is solely for our dev environment, and would not be a good practice\r\n	# within a production environment\r\n	Alias /CFIDE \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\"\r\n	<Directory \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\">\r\n		AllowOverride All\r\n		Order allow,deny\r\n		Allow from all\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	ErrorLog logs/username.companyname.loc-error.log\r\n	CustomLog logs/username.companyname.loc-access.log common\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis allowed me to place an index.cfm file inside my <em>wwwroot</em> directory, hit it from the browser, http://username.companyname.loc, and get a valid response. It also allows me to hit my ColdFusion administrator, of my default instance, by going to http://username.companyname.loc/CFIDE/Administrator in my browser.','Local-Development-Setup-Pt-1-Apache-and-ColdFusion-7-or-8','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',8388,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 ('E561E38B-3048-71C2-170630E3D4E6BC10','Local Development Setup Pt 2: Multiple ColdFusion Instances','Our last post discussed installing <a href=\"http://www.apache.org\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a>, as well as configuring your default instance for Apache access. Now it\'s time to create additional ColdFusion instances.\r\n\r\nBy default, ColdFusion (or, more appropriately, JRun) is only configured to utilize 512MB of RAM per instance, and is only capable of accessing 1024MB. This is due to a limitation of 32bit JVMs, and will someday be formerly addressed by Adobe. But that doesn\'t mean that you are necessarily restricted to only using 1GB of RAM for ColdFusion. You may define multiple instances of the server, each of which will address it\'s own memory space, it\'s own instance of the JVM, and it\'s own instance of ColdFusion (and JRun). Not only does this allow you to utilize more of the memory available to you today, in our high powered systems, but it will also sandbox applications that are separated into their own instances.\r\n\r\nFor instance: Let\'s say you have a dynamic template application. One that reads the requested URL and supplies customized content dependent upon the site identified. Any number of sites could be configured in a database, rendered by the same code, off of a single instance of ColdFusion (or a clustered set of instances, maybe). You could have a \'sites\' instance of ColdFusion that served this content. Now, the same set of sites might require a backend administrator, or content management system, for the configuration of those sites. You might set this up on a single domain name, with users logging in to their specific set of tools and data. It would be it\'s own application, with dynamic options and data according to the user logging in. This might be placed in another \'control\' instance of ColdFusion.\r\n\r\nSetting up additional instances of ColdFusion is easy, but requires a small bit of manual effort when working with Apache. First of all, the connectors for JRun and Apache are not completed automatic, so you need to setup a few folders on the file system. Find the root directory for JRun. The default location is <em>C:\\JRun4</em>. You are creating folder for the connectors, which will be located in the <em>{JRun Root}\\lib\\wsconfig</em>. Notice that there is already a subdirectory titled <em>1</em>. This is the connector for your default ColdFusion instance. You\'ll want to create an empty subdirectory for each instance you setup, named exactly as you will name your instances. According to the above example, you want to create a \'sites\' directory, and a \'control\' directory.\r\n\r\nYour next step requires logging into the ColdFusion Administrator of your default ColdFusion instance. In our last post we setup a url for accessing this, <em>http://username.companyname.loc/CFIDE/Administrator</em>. Once you\'ve logged in, in the default instance (and only the default instance) you will see an option at the bottom of the menu for <strong>Enterprise Manager</strong>. You\'ll want to select this, and it\'s sub-item, <strong>Instance Manager</strong>. Here you will see a <em>samples</em> instance that is already defined, though disabled. This is the instance for running the sample applications that ship with ColdFusion. To create a new instance you simply select <strong>Add New Instance</strong>. This will bring up the new instance dialog. In the server name type \'sites\' (exactly as you named the folder, including case) and select the <strong>Create Windows Service</strong> option, then hit <strong>Submit</strong>. That\'s it! ColdFusion automatically goes through a four step process to create your new instance, giving you status updates along the way. Once it\'s complete, go back to the <strong>Instance Manager</strong> and do the same thing for your \'control\' instance.\r\n\r\nOK, so you have new instances, but Apache still can\'t talk to them yet. We need to do a little more work on the Apache config before we can really start to play. The first thing you\'ll need to do here is locate the <em>JRun Settings</em> block in your httpd.conf. It\'ll look very similar to this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# JRun Settings\r\nLoadModule jrun_module \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so\"\r\n<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n	JRunConfig Verbose false\r\n	JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n	JRunConfig Ssl false\r\n	JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n	JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/jrunserver.store\"\r\n	JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51000\r\n	#JRunConfig Errorurl <optionally redirect to this URL on errors>\r\n	#JRunConfig ProxyRetryInterval <number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to unreachable clustered server>\r\n	#JRunConfig ConnectTimeout 15\r\n	#JRunConfig RecvTimeout 300\r\n	#JRunConfig SendTimeout 15\r\n	AddHandler jrun-handler .jsp .jws .cfm .cfml .cfc .cfr .cfswf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlright, some major points to notice here. Two big lines to look at for multiserver configuration stuff, the <em>Serverstore</em> and the <em>Bootstrap</em>. These will be different for each instance of ColdFusion. You probably already recognize most of the path in the <em>Serverstore</em> value. The \'control\' and \'sites\' instance folders that you had created will replace the <strong>1</strong> in your new definitions. The <em>Bootstrap</em> value comes from each instance\'s <em>port</em> setting in it\'s <em>JRunProxyService</em>. To get this value, go to that instance\'s <em>jrun.xml</em> file, located at <em>C:\\JRun4\\servers\\<strong>[instance name]</strong>\\SERVER-INF\\jrun.xml</em>. Open this file and find the following <em>service</em> definition block:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<service class=\"jrun.servlet.jrpp.JRunProxyService\" name=\"ProxyService\">\r\n	<attribute name=\"activeHandlerThreads\">25</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"backlog\">500</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"deactivated\">false</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"interface\">*</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"maxHandlerThreads\">1000</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"minHandlerThreads\">1</attribute>\r\n	<attribute name=\"port\">51002</attribute>\r\n	....\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nTwo things you need here. First, make sure that the <em>deactivated</em> attribute is set to <strong>false</strong>. Next, write down the <em>port</em> value. So, if you are in the <em>jrun.xml</em> of your \'control\' instance, and the <em>port</em> is \'51020\', then write that down (control: 51020) and do the same for your \'sites\' instance. Also remember that you will need to restart these instances after changing the <em>deactivated</em> attribute.\r\n\r\nNext, let\'s break out the default ColdFusion instance specific information and place it inside it\'s own include config file. In your Apache <em>conf</em> directory, create a new file - <em>cf_defaultinstance.conf</em>. In this file we\'ll place those settings we want for our default instance:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n	JRunConfig Verbose false\r\n	JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n	JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/jrunserver.store\"\r\n	JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51000\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWith these settings now within their own include, we can now remove them from the <em>httpd.conf</em> file:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# JRun Settings\r\nLoadModule jrun_module \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/mod_jrun20.so\"\r\n<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n	JRunConfig Verbose false\r\n	JRunConfig Apialloc false\r\n	JRunConfig Ssl false\r\n	JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n	#JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/1/jrunserver.store\"\r\n	#JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51000\r\n	#JRunConfig Errorurl <optionally redirect to this URL on errors>\r\n	#JRunConfig ProxyRetryInterval <number of seconds to wait before trying to reconnect to unreachable clustered server>\r\n	#JRunConfig ConnectTimeout 15\r\n	#JRunConfig RecvTimeout 300\r\n	#JRunConfig SendTimeout 15\r\n	AddHandler jrun-handler .jsp .jws .cfm .cfml .cfc .cfr .cfswf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice that I just commented them out. You can remove the entirely if you like, but I\'m gonna leave it. Next I\'m going to adjust my <em>VirtualHost</em> for my default instance administrator access:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n#\r\n# Use name-based virtual hosting.\r\n#\r\nNameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80\r\n\r\n	....\r\n\r\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	# Root folder for my scratchpad stuff\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\"\r\n	ServerName username.companyname.loc\r\n	# Alias for /CFIDE, which the CF install placed in my Apache webroot.\r\n	# This is solely for our dev environment, and would not be a good practice\r\n	# within a production environment\r\n	Alias /CFIDE \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\"\r\n	<Directory \"C:/Program Files/Apache Group/Apache2/htdocs/CFIDE\">\r\n		AllowOverride All\r\n		Order allow,deny\r\n		Allow from all\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	ErrorLog logs/username.companyname.loc-error.log\r\n	CustomLog logs/username.companyname.loc-access.log common\r\n	# SGB [072007]: Add include for default ColdFusion instance\r\n	Include conf/cf_defaultinstance.conf\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow <em>username.companyname.loc</em> is setup to use the default ColdFusion instance. Next, setup an include for your \'control\' instance. In Apache\'s <em>conf</em> directory, create another config file - <em>cf_controlinstance.conf</em>. Remember those <em>port</em> numbers you wrote down from the <em>jrun.xml</em> files? It\'s in the <em>Bootstrap</em>:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<IfModule mod_jrun20.c>\r\n	JRunConfig Verbose false\r\n	JRunConfig Ignoresuffixmap false\r\n	JRunConfig Serverstore \"C:/JRun4/lib/wsconfig/control/jrunserver.store\"\r\n	JRunConfig Bootstrap 127.0.0.1:51020\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThen you could define a special domain for accessing the \'control\' instance\'s ColdFusion Administrator, by adding another <em>VirtualHost</em> directive to the Apache config:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	# Root folder for a \'control\' instance\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\admin\"\r\n	ServerName control.companyname.loc\r\n	# Alias for /CFIDE, each CF instance has it\'s own CFIDE.\r\n	# This is solely for our dev environment, and would not be a good practice\r\n	# within a production environment\r\n	Alias /CFIDE \"C:/JRun4/servers/control/cfusion.ear/cfusion.war/CFIDE\"\r\n	<Directory \"C:/JRun4/servers/control/cfusion.ear/cfusion.war/CFIDE\">\r\n		AllowOverride All\r\n		Order allow,deny\r\n		Allow from all\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	ErrorLog logs/control.companyname.loc-error.log\r\n	CustomLog logs/control.companyname.loc-access.log common\r\n	# SGB [072007]: Add include for the \'control\' ColdFusion instance\r\n	Include conf/cf_controlinstance.conf\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice the different path for the CFIDE folder. Each created instance will have a unique CFIDE. Also notice that I changed the <em>DocumentRoot</em> path, to reflect the root of the application I\'ll use with the instance. Now that you\'ve setup your \'control\' instance, config, and VirtualHost, you can do the same thing for your \'sites\' instance. Just watch your <em>port</em> value, <em>Serverstore</em> path, and <em>CFIDE</em> and <em>DocumentRoot</em> paths.','2007-07-23 08:01:00',NULL,'Local-Development-Setup-Pt-2-Multiple-ColdFusion-Instances','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',5921,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 ('E5629FB7-3048-71C2-17126F7A43E6B14C','Local Development Setup Pt 3: Virtual Directories in Apache','In a previous post we touched upon the <em>Alias</em> statement in your <em>VirtualHost</em> directives. An <em>Alias</em> is a way of defining a virtual directory for your site. This is a pretty common practice in the web world. Your site code may be stored in your site\'s root (wwwroot) folder, but you may want to store your assets (images, video, stylesheets, etc.) outside your webroot. You might even want to store them on another server altogether. You\'ll want to access these items as if they\'re part of your site, like <em>http://username.companyname.loc/Images/mypic.jpg</em> or <em>http://username.companyname.loc/Media/myvideo.flv</em>.\r\n\r\nDefining an <em>Alias</em> is easy, when dealing with your local file system. An <em>Alias</em> that points to a UNC path, in Windows, is another story. You have to use a UNC path because Apache will not allow you to utilize a mapped drive (it\'ll crash Apache, at least under 2.0). What took me a while to figure out was that you can not use Apache to control the directory access (as in permissions), you must do this through the user account access. You <strong>can not</strong> use the <em>Directory</em> Apache directives for access control. This also means that your Apache instance must run as the user who has access to the remote resource (I also setup CF instance to run as the same user).\r\n\r\nI also discovered something else the hard way, Apache Aliases are case-specific. This means that you have to use double Aliases for each virtual directory that you define via an Alias. Remember, this is Windows, so code can go either way. You\'ll want to plan for either eventuality.\r\n\r\nIn our last post we defined a \'sites\' instance, for the display of a mythical, templated application system. So, imagine that each site of that system would require it\'s own <em>VirtualHost</em> directive. Each one, though, would also be using shared media resources from the same location outside the webroot, like on a media server. For this, you can create another include in your Apache <em>conf</em> folder - <em>site_aliases.conf</em>, within which you could singularly define your remote virtual directories:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nAlias /Images/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/Images/\r\n\r\nAlias /images/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/Images/\r\n\r\nAlias /Video/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/Video/\r\n\r\nAlias /video/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/Video/\r\n\r\nAlias /Styles/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/Styles/\r\n\r\nAlias /styles/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/Styles/\r\n\r\nAlias /SiteSpecific/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/SiteSpecific/\r\n\r\nAlias /sitespecific/ //remote-serv1/Inetpub/wwwroot/SiteSpecific/\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve defined these remote shared resources, you can then <em>Include</em> them in your site definitions in your <em>VirtualHost</em> directives:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:80>\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	# Root folder for thisdomain.com, in the \'sites\' instance\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\siteroot\"\r\n	ServerName *.thisdomain.loc\r\n	# SGB [072007]: shared Alias Include\r\n	Include conf/site_aliases.conf\r\n	ErrorLog logs/thisdomain.loc-error.log\r\n	CustomLog logs/thisdomain.loc-access.log common\r\n	# SGB [072007]: Add include for the \'sites\' ColdFusion instance\r\n	Include conf/cf_sitesinstance.conf\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOnce you\'ve restarted your Apache instance you will be able to access these resources as part of the domain.','2007-07-23 08:02:00',NULL,'Local-Development-Setup-Pt-3-Virtual-Directories-in-Apache','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',7267,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

What\'s left? Well, what if you need to test SSL secure pages? Perhaps you have areas of your sites that need to have secure encryption, where you\'re harvesting personal information from your users. No one feels comfortable submitting personal information online if they don\'t see that little lock in the bottom of their browser. You, as a developer, want to be able to code this functionality, without the need to test it in your production environment.\r\n\r\nWith a little work, setting up a secure site within Apache is relatively simple. You already completed your first step when you installed ColdFusion and Apache, because the <a href=\"http://www.pangex.com/pub/apache/httpd/binaries/win32/apache_2.0.59-win32-x86-openssl-0.9.7j.msi\" target=\"_blank\">Apache version you installed was precompiled for SSL</a>. With a few more steps you\'ll be on your way.\r\n\r\nDownload the <em>openssl.cnf.txt</em> file from the <em>Download</em> link below, and place the file in your Apache <em>bin</em> directory (<em>C:\\Program Files\\Apache Group\\Apache2\\bin</em>). Then, rename the file, removing the <em>.txt</em> extension. After you\'ve done this, you may not see the remaining <em>.cnf</em> extension in your file browser, and it may say that it\'s a <em>SpeedDial</em> file type. That\'s OK, it\'s supposed to look that way. The next thing you need to do is copy the <em>ssleay32.dll</em> and <em>lebeay32.dll</em> files from your <em>bin</em> folder into your <em>Windows\\System32</em> folder. Make sure you copy the .dll files and not the .lib files. Now you\'re ready to create your personal security certificates.\r\n\r\nOpen a command prompt and navigate to your <em>bin</em> folder. Once there you can begin to use the openssl executable to create your certs. You will need one for each secure site you configure. Here we\'ll create one for <em>secure.companyname.loc</em>, by executing the following commands in your console.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nopenssl req -config openssl.cnf -new -out secure.csr\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe .csr file can have any name, but I\'ve named it like this so I know that it\'s associated with my \'secure\' domain. Note that you must create a certificate for each <em>fully qualified domain name</em> that you wish to be secure. The web browser will scream if the domain names don\'t match exactly. Here is a step by step of what you should see, with my responses bracketed by percentage signs.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nLoading \'screen\' into random state - done\r\nGenerating a 1024 bit RSA private key\r\n........++++++\r\n.......++++++\r\nwriting new private key to \'privkey.pem\'\r\nEnter PEM pass phrase: %my-made-up-pass%\r\nVerifying - Enter PEM pass phrase: %my-made-up-pass%\r\n-----\r\nYou are about to be asked to enter information that will be incorporated into your certificate request.\r\nWhat you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN.\r\nThere are quite a few fields but you can leave some blank\r\nFor some fields there will be a default value,\r\nIf you enter \'.\', the field will be left blank.\r\n-----\r\nCountry Name (2 letter code) []:%US%\r\nState or Province Name (full name) []:%mystate%\r\nLocality Name (eg, city) []:%mycity%\r\nOrganization Name (eg, company) []:%companyname%\r\nOrganizational Unit Name (eg, section) []:%mydept%\r\nCommon Name (eg, your websites domain name) []:%secure.companyname.loc%\r\nEmail Address []:%username@companyname.com%\r\n\r\nPlease enter the following \'extra\' attributes\r\nto be sent with your certificate request\r\nA challenge password []:%my-made-up-pass%\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis will create the <em>.csr</em> file. Now, on to the next step, the private key file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nopenssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out secure.key\r\nEnter pass phrase for privkey.pem:%my-made-up-pass%\r\nwriting RSA key\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOk, now that we have a private key all that\'s left is to get a certificate.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nopenssl x509 -in secure.csr -out secure.cert -req -signkey secure.key -days 365\r\nLoading \'screen\' into random state - done\r\nSignature OK\r\nsubject=/C=US/ST=mystate/L=mycity/O=companyname/OU=mydept/CN=secure.companyname.loc/emailAddress=username@companyname.com\r\nGetting Private key\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlright, now you have your certificate for your \'secure\' domain. Create, within your Apache <em>conf</em> folder, two new folders <em>ssl.cert</em> and <em>ssl.key</em>, and move your <em>secure.cert</em> and <em>secure.key</em> files into their respective folders. You may also delete the <em>.rnd</em> file from your Apache <em>bin</em> folder. This file contains entropy information for creating the key and could be used for cryptographic attacks against your private key. Although this isn\'t likely within your local development environment, it is still good practice.\r\n\r\nAs this is for your local environment, this is a simple way of creating a self-signed certificate for development use. All you have to do is install the certificate in your browser the first time you come to a secure page. Also note that this certificate expires after a year, and you can increase the <em>-days 365</em> if you want.\r\n\r\nNow we start getting into actually configuring your server for your SSL connection. First you will want to remove the comment hash (#) from the LoadModule line for <em>ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so</em>. This is generally the last line of the LoadModule descriptors in your <em>httpd.conf</em> file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# SGB: [072408]: Enabling SSL\r\nLoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext you\'ll find the IfModule block below:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\r\n	Include conf/ssl.conf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd add a few necessary lines:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<IfModule mod_ssl.c>\r\n	Include conf/ssl.conf\r\n</IfModule>\r\n# SGB [072408]: Some added config for our SSL\r\nSSLMutex default\r\nSSLRandomSeed startup builtin\r\nSSLSessionCache none\r\nErrorLog logs/ssl.log\r\nLogLevel info\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIt is <strong>very</strong> important that you move this descriptor block <strong>below</strong> the <em>JRun Settings</em> descriptor block. When you define which instance serves your secure pages you want it to know the JRun is needed.\r\n\r\nThe next step took a great deal of trial and error to get straight. First, make a backup copy of the <em>ssl.conf</em> file. Then, within the original file, we\'re going to make several changes. First, comment (with a hash sign [#]) the opening and closing IfDefine tags near the top and very bottom of the file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# SGB [072408]: Removed for proper load\r\n#<IfDefine SSL>\r\n	....\r\n# SGB [072408]: Removed for proper load\r\n#</IfDefine>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd, set it up for <em>NameVirtualHost</em>, just as you did within your <em>httpd.conf</em>, but with the correct port for SSL.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# SGB [072408]: Enable NameVirtualHost configurations on SSL\r\nNameVirtualHost 127.0.0.1:443\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext, remove the entire VirtualHost block from the file. This is loaded with lines and lines of comments, is already in your backup file for later reference, and only confuses what is needed (and caused me errors somewhere anyway). We\'ll setup a \'secure\' VirtualHost entry for your secure domain, using the certificate and key you created before.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# SGB [072408]: \'secure\' SSL domain setup directive\r\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:443>\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\siteroot\"\r\n	ServerName secure.companyname.loc\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	ErrorLog logs/secure-ssl-error.log\r\n	TransferLog logs/secure-ssl-access.log\r\n	SSLEngine On\r\n	SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL\r\n	SSLCertificateFile conf/ssl.cert/secure.cert\r\n	SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/ssl.key/secure.key\r\n	<FilesMatch \"\\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|cfm|cfc|php3?)$\">\r\n		SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\r\n	</FilesMatch>\r\n	<Directory \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\siteroot\">\r\n		SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	SetEnvIf User-Agent \".*MSIE.*\" \\\r\n			 nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\r\n			 downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\r\n	CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \\\r\n			  \"%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \\\"%r\\\" %b\"\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOK, what\'s left? Oh yeah! We need a ColdFusion instance to associate it with (in this case the \'sites\' instance). And, we\'ll probably need those Aliases too. Easy enough. Just add your <em>Include</em> statements.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# SGB [072408]: \'secure\' SSL domain setup directive\r\n<VirtualHost 127.0.0.1:443>\r\n	DocumentRoot \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\siteroot\"\r\n	ServerName secure.companyname.loc\r\n	ServerAdmin username@companyname.com\r\n	ErrorLog logs/secure-ssl-error.log\r\n	TransferLog logs/secure-ssl-access.log\r\n	SSLEngine On\r\n	SSLCipherSuite ALL:!ADH:!EXPORT56:RC4+RSA:+HIGH:+MEDIUM:+LOW:+SSLv2:+EXP:+eNULL\r\n	SSLCertificateFile conf/ssl.cert/secure.cert\r\n	SSLCertificateKeyFile conf/ssl.key/secure.key\r\n	<FilesMatch \"\\.(cgi|shtml|phtml|cfm|cfc|php3?)$\">\r\n		SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\r\n	</FilesMatch>\r\n	<Directory \"C:\\Documents and Settings\\username\\My Documents\\wwwroot\\siteroot\">\r\n		SSLOptions +StdEnvVars\r\n	</Directory>\r\n	SetEnvIf User-Agent \".*MSIE.*\" \\\r\n			 nokeepalive ssl-unclean-shutdown \\\r\n			 downgrade-1.0 force-response-1.0\r\n	CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \\\r\n			  \"%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \\\"%r\\\" %b\"\r\n	Include conf/cf_sitesinstance.conf\r\n	Include conf/site_aliases.conf\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThat\'s it! Restart your Apache server and go to <em>https://secure.companyname.loc</em> (make sure your put a test \'index.cfm\' in there). First you will be asked to accept the development certificate that you created, and then you should see your test message display, with the little lock down in the corner.\r\n\r\nAnd that is how to configure ColdFusion (7 or 8) on top of Apache, in a multi-instance configuration, with virtual, UNC pathed directories, SSL support, and access to your instance administrators.

One of which has been implementing a new <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS</a> DataGrid in a project I\'m working on. Sure, there\'s a lot more going on, but that\'s becoming a nice front end piece. As previously promised, I want to look at a <em>renderer</em>.','2007-08-22 09:07:00','<h2>What Is A Renderer?</h2>\r\n		Hey, not everything you get back from your paging query will be formatted in the way you want it displayed. I\'m going to show you a really simple example, dealing with a boolean value. Let\'s start off by writing a renderer function. Here\'s the deal, you have a query column with a boolean value (bIsActive), which is returned as either 1 or 0. You want the grid to display <em>Yes</em> or <em>No</em>. You could define the function directly in your ColumnModel declaration:\r\n		\r\n<code>\r\n			...\r\n			,{\r\n			header:\'Active\',\r\n			dataIndex:\'bIsActive\',\r\n			renderer:function(value){\r\n				return (value == 1)?\'Yes\':\'No\';}\r\n			}\r\n			...\r\n		</code>\r\n		\r\nEasy, right? But, it\'s not really reusable is it? So, it\'s better to define the function, then register that function as the renderer for the column. Now, there isn\'t a ton of documentation on exactly what\'s going on here, but there are a lot of examples, so I\'ll try to give you what I\'ve figured out, plus what I believe to be right (if you know it better then let us all know).\r\n\r\n		A renderer function will take at least one argument by default, that being the <em>value</em> of the cell being rendered. You do not explicitly call a renderer, the arguments passed to the renderer are dependent upon the function definition. For something as simple as a Yes/No boolean renderer the <em>value</em> is all that\'s necessary. So you would define a renderer function, and register it, like this:\r\n\r\n		<code>\r\n			function renderBoolean(value){\r\n				return String.format(\"{0}\",(value==1)?\'Yes\':\'No\');\r\n			}\r\n\r\n			// And a redefinition of of the renderer in the ColumnModel\r\n			...\r\n			,{\r\n			header:\'Active\',\r\n			dataIndex:\'bIsActive\',\r\n			renderer:renderBoolean\r\n			}\r\n			...\r\n		</code>\r\n		\r\nDid you see it? No parens on the end of that renderer config property in the ColumnModel, and no arguments explicitly passed. That\'s all covered by the ExtJS framework. But wait, it gets better. We had to columns in the data store that relate to a person\'s name (vcFirstName and vcLastName). What if we just wanted to concantenate the two values? Well for that we would probably need the entire record. No problem, you just change things up a bit:\r\n\r\n		<code>\r\n			function renderName(value,p,r){\r\n				return String.format(\"{0} {1}\", value, r.data[\'vcLastName\']);\r\n			}\r\n                        // Combine our \'name\' columns into one\r\n			...\r\n			,{\r\n			header:\'Name\',\r\n			dataIndex:\'vcFirstName\',\r\n			renderer:renderName\r\n			}\r\n			...\r\n		</code>\r\n		\r\nOK, three arguments, with one never used. Well, it wasn\'t used in this case, but it\'s necessary, as you can\'t get the third argument (the data record) passed into the renderer without also passing in the second argument. What\'s the second argument? Well, that\'s a great question. I\'m fairly sure that it is the element object of the container of the value, but I could be very wrong. In this particular case it doesn\'t matter, but I\'ll give you another item renderer in a future post where it will play a part.\r\n\r\nYou\'ll also want to note the the JavaScript bind variable syntax being used in the String.format() function, {[value]}. The numbers used here are like array position values, starting at zero, for all of the variables passed in the arguments that follow the string you are formatting (the first argument of the function).\r\n\r\n		So, that\'s a quick down and dirty on renderers. No download with this particular post, but the code samples above aren\'t overly difficult to integrate. You can, absolutely, do some much more complex renderer functions, but this should be a good start.','My-First-ExtJS-DataGrid-Pt-7-Custom-Cell-Renderers','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',38700,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

See, we have this FNG (Fairly New Guy, get your mind out of the gutter) in our office, working in our SEO/SEM department, who\'s been hacking away in PHP trying to make a few tools for their team. Since he wants to tap into our databases, and write tools that interface with the rest of our system, he is now going to start learning <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a>. Not much of a stretch, and I\'m confident that, once he\'s into it, he\'s really going to enjoy himself.

For shame! Sorry folks, I\'ve been busy.','2007-09-28 06:31:00','Let me give you a little run down. My daughter started school, with some separation anxiety in the mix. Our best friends moved to Nashville, staying with us for three weeks while they found a place and a job. We went to my grandmother\'s 79 and 2/3rds birthday party (long story, don\'t ask). And, oh yeah, I\'ve been finishing off a nice project at the office. Nothing massive, but important for us. I\'m very happy with it, as it adds some nice functionality to our system, with some nice, reusable code, and certain aspects written to benefit even beyond this product. It also allowed me to get my hands really dirty with Ajax and the <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS library</a>.\r\n\r\nNow, some of you may be asking \"But Cutter, why aren\'t you just using the Ajax widgets built into ColdFusion 8.\" Fair question. Well, right now we\'re not using ColdFusion 8. We\'re set to migrate when we switch our datacenters in a few months. We\'ve had the pleasure of thoroughly testing in 8, and are happy that we haven\'t had to change a single line of code. But, knowing that we\'re moving to 8, and realizing that we\'ll use it\'s Ajax widgets for <a href=\"/index.cfm/2007/6/5/The-ColdFusion-8-AJAX-Components-Debate\" target=\"_blank\">rapid application prototyping</a>, it made sense to use the ExtJS components for the project. This is so the \"look and feel\" would maintain consistency down the line. Here\'s the great thing though, I really love the library, and I got to really play with a number of different pieces. I built a DataGrid, with custom cell renderers and event handlers, created a custom LayoutDialog with tabbed, Ajax fed content, added in tooltips and help text/dialogs, and even threw in a little <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a> to help out with Ajax fed related selects...Lot\'s of cool stuff, which I\'m hoping to share (the ins and outs) in the near future. I\'m probably going to start with some tutorials that are focused on using the CF8 components (and using the sample <a href=\"http://db.apache.org/derby/\" target=\"_blank\">Derby</a> databases that come with the server install), extend them some with JavaScript, then really flesh \'em out with some more advanced Ext functionality, or replace them with the Ext components all together. With <a href=\"http://extjs.com/blog/2007/09/06/ext-20-a-preview/\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS 2.0</a> on the horizon, it\'s good to have some background.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, I submitted the 1,000th site to <a href=\"http://www.gotcfm.com\" target=\"_blank\">GotCFM.com</a>. I saw that post to the <a href=\"http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">CF-Talk</a> list, from Rey Bengo, about the contest, and immediately started fishing through old sites to submit. The first site I submitted, for the <a href=\"http://www.apposchooldistrict.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Appoquinimink School District</a> of Delaware, was the winner.

Good thing for me, since most of those widgets are built using the Ext library.\r\n\r\nWell, the Ext team has done it again. Or, rather, they\'ve outdone themselves.

I\'ve already had the opportunity to preview some of this outstanding new stuff, and it is way above the bar. The Ext crew has been hard at work, mulling over thousands of forum entries, emails, etc, enhancing and refining this excellent toolset. The <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-2.0-alpha1/examples/\" target=\"_blank\">samples page</a> showcases some of the new features and enhancements, and is now separated from the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-2.0-alpha1/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">API Browser</a>, which is a thing of beauty in it\'s own right.\r\n\r\nThere are some heavy changes under the hood, with migration documentation soon to be released to ease the transitions. I wouldn\'t expect to see the new stuff built into ColdFusion anytime soon, but it would be tremendous if Adobe made that happen in an upcoming update (NOTE: Adobe has said no such thing, I just wish they would;). And anyone interested in client side JS code should read through the \'source\' files that are included in the download. Simply amazing.\r\n\r\nIt\'s very expandable too. I\'ve already added to the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-2.0-alpha1/examples/grid/grid3.html\" target=\"_blank\">RowExpander Plugin</a>, for the DataGrid, to take a function reference argument in it\'s config, so that I could populate the \'expanded\' area with Ajax fed content, basically in the same vain of setting a custom cell renderer but only \'onclick\'.\r\n\r\nSo, looks like I\'ll have to write some new DataGrid articles, which I\'ve also begun to crosspost onto the Ext site in their <a href=\"http://extjs.com/learn/\" target=\"_blank\">Learning Center</a>.

One of the reasons is I\'ve been waiting on her to get approval to get a feed of listings, so we can put them directly on her site. Well, she finally got the approval, so I\'ve been having fun this weekend, pulling in data and images, setting up database tables. The Works.\r\n\r\nThese feeds are tab delimited text files. The first line being a listing of all of the columns, with all of the rest being the data. So, I set up a staging table, with column names that match those in the file (luckily they provide a listing of the columns, along with their data type and length, in a separate .log file). Next, I used the <a href=\"http://cfcgenerator.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">Illudium PU-36 Code Generator</a> to quickly give me some data access objects, and then settled down to write a little code.\r\n\r\nNow, my first file has 7,000+ records in it, so I go ahead and give myself a little time for the code to do it\'s job.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfsetting enablecfoutputonly=\"true\" requesttimeout=\"600\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNext thing I wanted were a few variables and objects to work with.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfset VARIABLES.lineNum = 1 />\r\n<cfset VARIABLES.filePath = expandPath(\".\") & \"\\myFile.txt\" />\r\n<cfset VARIABLES.Bean = CreateObject(\"component\",\"feedRecord\") />\r\n<cfset VARIABLES.DAO = CreateObject(\"component\",\"feedRecordDAO\").init(APPLICATION.dsn) />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd then I setup the loop on the file.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfloop file=\"#VARIABLES.filePath#\" index=\"VARIABLES.line\">\r\n	<!--- Code to go here --->\r\n</cfloop>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOK, for those who don\'t know, the DAO object that is created by the code generator takes a bean object as the argument for the <b>save()</b> method. The bean object has an <b>init()</b> method with all of the column names as non-required arguments. So, how to best initialize my bean? Well, the data file\'s first row is a tab delimited list of the column names, so I decide to use it. First, I only want the first row to give me a data structure of the column names, in the order I\'ll need them. Hmmm? Ok, I decide to use an Array.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfloop file=\"#VARIABLES.filePath#\" index=\"VARIABLES.line\">\r\n	<cfif VARIABLES.lineNum gt 1>\r\n		<!--- This is for later --->\r\n	<cfelse>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.propOrder = ArrayNew(1) />\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.lineCount = 1 />\r\n		<cfloop list=\"#VARIABLES.line#\" index=\"VARIABLES.listItem\" delimiters=\"#Chr(9)#\">\r\n			<cfset VARIABLES.propOrder[VARIABLES.lineCount] = VARIABLES.listItem />\r\n			<cfset VARIABLES.lineCount++ />\r\n		</cfloop>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.lineCount = 0 />\r\n	</cfif>\r\n	<cfset VARIABLES.lineNum++ />\r\n</cfloop>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice that the first part of my flow control is currently blank. This area I left at the beginning, as most lines will meet this criteria, and that\'s where the meat of the processing will be handled in the end. This Array, though very important, is only handled on the first row of the file. It will process first, because of the way the flow control is written, but bypassed throughout the rest of the process. BTW, I love the JS style operators;)\r\n\r\nNow, I used an Array to maintain the order of the key names, but ultimately I\'ll need a Struct to pass into the bean\'s init() method, as an <b>argumentCollection</b>.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfloop file=\"#VARIABLES.filePath#\" index=\"VARIABLES.line\">\r\n	<cfif VARIABLES.lineNum gt 1>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.resProp = StructNew() />\r\n	....\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow, I was going to list loop through each line to set my Struct, but found out the hard way that &lt;cfloop&gt; still doesn\'t like empty items in a string. I was getting errors all over the place about truncated data and what, before I noticed data wasn\'t in the right place. What to do? Take a different approach! Instead of looping a list, I\'ll loop an Array, and make my Array from the list, while using the new <em>includeEmptyFields</em> option.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfloop file=\"#VARIABLES.filePath#\" index=\"VARIABLES.line\">\r\n	<cfif VARIABLES.lineNum gt 1>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.resProp = StructNew() />\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.arrProps = ListToArray(VARIABLES.line,Chr(9),true) />\r\n		<cfloop from=\"1\" to=\"#ArrayLen(VARIABLES.propOrder)#\" index=\"VARIABLES.itemCount\">\r\n			<cfset VARIABLES.resProp[VARIABLES.propOrder[VARIABLES.itemCount]] = VARIABLES.arrProps[VARIABLES.itemCount] />\r\n		</cfloop>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nDid you see it? Simple, eh? Now I have a Struct, where the data from each line matches up with the keys set from the first line of the file. All that\'s left is to set my bean and pass it to the save() method of the DAO.\r\n\r\n<cfloop file=\"#VARIABLES.filePath#\" index=\"VARIABLES.line\">\r\n	<cfif VARIABLES.lineNum gt 1>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.resProp = StructNew() />\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.arrProps = ListToArray(VARIABLES.line,Chr(9),true) />\r\n		<cfloop from=\"1\" to=\"#ArrayLen(VARIABLES.propOrder)#\" index=\"VARIABLES.itemCount\">\r\n			<cfset VARIABLES.resProp[VARIABLES.propOrder[VARIABLES.itemCount]] = VARIABLES.arrProps[VARIABLES.itemCount] />\r\n		</cfloop>\r\n		<cfoutput>Saving Record ## #VARIABLES.lineNum#. </cfoutput>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.Bean.init(argumentCollection:VARIABLES.resProp) />\r\n		<cftry>\r\n			<cfif VARIABLES.DAO.save(VARIABLES.Bean)>\r\n				<cfoutput>Record saved.<br /></cfoutput>\r\n			<cfelse>\r\n				<cfoutput>Error saving record.<br /></cfoutput>\r\n				<!--- custom cfthrow here --->\r\n			</cfif>\r\n			<cfcatch type=\"any\">\r\n				<!--- and a custom error handler here --->\r\n			</cfcatch>\r\n		</cftry>\r\n		<cfflush />\r\n	<cfelse>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.propOrder = ArrayNew(1) />\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.lineCount = 1 />\r\n		<cfloop list=\"#VARIABLES.line#\" index=\"VARIABLES.listItem\" delimiters=\"#Chr(9)#\">\r\n			<cfset VARIABLES.propOrder[VARIABLES.lineCount] = VARIABLES.listItem />\r\n			<cfset VARIABLES.lineCount++ />\r\n		</cfloop>\r\n		<cfset VARIABLES.lineCount = 0 />\r\n	</cfif>\r\n	<cfset VARIABLES.lineNum++ />\r\n</cfloop>\r\n<cfsetting enablecfoutputonly=\"false\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThat\'s it! Nothing to it! Now, there are probably better ways, and half of this should be encapsulated even further, and <em>it will break</em> if the feed provider changes the column names.

First I built a basic CFC, with a remote access method that pulls all of the records from the Art table of the cfartgallery db. Then I built the display page, with the cfgrid and cfgridcolumn tags. I used the bind attribute to bind the grid to the cfc method. Tried it out and...error.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nCFGRID: Response is empty [Enable debugging by adding \'cfdebug\' to your URL parameters to see more information.]\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOK. Fun. No response messages showing in Firebug, but the right parameters were getting passed through. Google is your friend, right? One reference that I could find, in the comments on a post at <a href=\"http://www.forta.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben\'s</a> site, but it only pointed me towards the Application.cfc, with no explanation on what the problem was or how to fix it.\r\n\r\nSo, I changed the file name of my Application.cfc.

OK, so what\'s in the Application.cfc?\r\n\r\nWell, I had already commented out the onError method (figuring out an issue with Coldspring). There wasn\'t any output in any of the methods. I went over all of my attributes and mappings...nothing.

 ('EEE6E5A8-3048-71C2-173BB32E33BC8648','Watch What You Write, Someone Is Reading','Today I received the following comment here, on an older post on <a href=\"/index.cfm/2007/1/13/Variables-and-Naming-Conventions\" target=\"_blank\">Variables and Naming Conventions</a>:\r\n	\r\n	<blockquote>\r\n		...I wish Adobe would publish and adopt some kind of\r\nofficial naming convention. Sometimes reading sample code written in\r\nsome other convention can make things harder to follow...\r\n	</blockquote>\r\n	\r\n	It was almost funny that this comment had come in when it had. Recently I was doing a lot of research for a User Group presentation I just did on the new ColdFusion 8 Ajax Components (have to re-record it before public release). In the process, I spent a great deal of time going over documentation all over the internet, from <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">LiveDocs</a> to countless blogs, absorbing the wealth of information that is already out there. It was outstanding that there were so many resources out there for people to learn from. On the other hand, it was a little sad that so much of the sample code was written in ways that can really start new developers off with some bad habits.\r\n	\r\n\r\n	I\'m not perfect, by any means, but I try to pay careful attention to the code that I place on this blog for readers to use and learn from. One thing that I attempt to do is pay attention to basic Web Standards, like using XHTML (the current standard) instead of HTML, keeping styles in the stylesheet, and having unobtrusive JavaScript. I don\'t always do it, sometimes it doesn\'t make sense for a quick example, but I try, especially within code downloads. I also try to adhere to my own <a href=\"/index.cfm/General-Coding-Guidelines\" target=\"_blank\">Coding Guidelines</a>, so that code appears to be consistent and easy to read and understand.\r\n	\r\n\r\n	Probably the one that bothers me the most, and that I see most prevalent in blogs, documentation, and books, is the lack of proper variable scoping. I know that, often, we\'re just publishing quick examples, but this can be an extremely detrimental practice. I have worked on some very large enterprise applications, with years of code written by half-a-dozen different developers, most of whom learned their ColdFusion (and development) skills through the docs or a book. Many had actually come up with some very creative and effective algorithms to fix some issue, or create some new whiz bang feature, but their code was so poorly scoped that, after time, it could take down the server. Why? How? Enterprise sites may contain several hundred (or thousand) templates, containing dozens of variables on each page, and can potentially be hit by hundreds (or thousands) of users simultaneously. Multiply the number of variables by the number of pages by the number of users, then imagine ColdFusion doing a ScopeCheck on each one, to figure out which scope each variable requested belongs in. Even if the variable <em>is</em> in the VARIABLES scope, it\'s still that many times ScopeCheck will be called while rendering a page.\r\n	\r\n\r\n	Still not convinced? Go download <a href=\"http://varscoper.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">varScoper</a>, and run it on your project root folder, including your subfolders, and see what it comes up with. Yeah, I\'m still in shock. Cleanup on that is easier on a small subproject scale, but it\'s definitely forced me to <strong>think</strong> better when I\'m writing my code, <em>paying attention</em> as I go, to minimize the performance impact of my applications, no matter how small it may be. I learned my bad habits from the docs, various books, sample code slung around on the <a href=\"http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">CF-Talk list.</a> I\'ve continued to realize that there are better ways of doing things (like <a href=\"http://www.cfoop.org\" target=\"_blank\">OOP</a> and frameworks), and adjust my style and methods, and I think it\'s important to consider these \'best practices\' when contributing. A little more code, but the right thing to do in the end, for you, your app, and your systems.\r\n	\r\n\r\n	So, if you own a site of documentation, revise it. If you\'re writing a book, edit it. If you publish a CF blog, live it. The up-and-coming are reading us all of the time to find out how to use this wonderful language. Let\'s try to show \'em how to do it the <strong>right</strong> way. You might not follow any guidelines at all, within your development, but this scoping thing is way too important to gloss over, and will only help everyone in the long run.','2007-10-29 23:12:00',NULL,'Watch-What-You-Write-Someone-Is-Reading','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',3511,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

You have to read through the first few messages in the thread before you really start getting into the meat of the discussion, with some great comments from <a href=\"http://corfield.org\" target=\"_blank\">Sean Corfield</a> and <a href=\"http://www.pbell.com\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Bell</a>.\r\n\r\nIt goes back to the ongoing <a href=\"http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2007/7/25/Design-Patterns-Debate\" target=\"_blank\">Design Patterns Debate</a>, making it\'s way around the ColdFusion community. Many have adopted the Table Row Pattern, used by popular ORMs, almost as a standard for development. But is this the right way to go with ColdFusion? Are we writing too much code to accomplish simple tasks?\r\n\r\nSean takes some responsibility for this thought process, believing that some of this has stemmed from his <a href=\"http://livedocs.adobe.com/wtg/public/machiidevguide/structure.html\" target=\"_blank\">Mach-II Development Guidelines</a> doc while at Adobe. While that may be somewhat true, I think that it probably stems more from the fact that OO is still fairly new to the ColdFusion world. While we\'ve been capable of writing OO code since the introduction of CFCs in 6.1, adoption of the concept has been slow, and only truly picked up major steam over the last two years or more.\r\n\r\nIn the thread, Sean knocks on the large adoption of the 5:1 business object concept. He doesn\'t state that it\'s completely wrong, only that it may be overkill in most cases, and should not be the end-all-be-all. While the Bean-DAO-Gateway paradigm may be great for simple CRUD type operations, and simple table fillers, it\'s not well suited to complex objects. A Factory approach may be a better option. The primary point is, there is No One Way, and that we shouldn\'t pigeon hole ourselves into design patterns that are primarily designed for Java, when ColdFusion (being typeless) has more in common with languages like Ruby, Python or Groovy.\r\n\r\nThere is no One Way, or even Wrong Way, and maybe it\'s time for all of us to begin thinking outside the box again. We can build great, rapid, OO applications, if we just start doing it.\r\n\r\n<i>I\'ve paraphrased some stuff here, so if I\'ve gotten someone\'s comments wrong, or completely mixed up, I apologize now and please feel free to correct me.</i>','2007-11-02 12:39:00',NULL,'ColdFusion-OO-Architecture-Get-Out-Of-The-Box','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2246,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 ('924FD535-3048-71C2-1732C7C676604ABE','CF8 Ajax Grid: Renderers and Events','So, I was doing a real quick, down and dirty form and results app for something internal. Way temporary, with little scale-out, I wrote a form and processor, then used the CF8 DataGrid for the results display. Problem was, two of the fields were textareas that could contain a lot of info, so I needed a quick way to show and expanded details set. Now, had I been using <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank>Ext 2.0</a>, I could have just used something like the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/grid/grid3.html\" target=\"_blank\">ExpanderRow</a> plugin, but this was just quick implementation prototyping type stuff.\r\n\r\nWhat I needed was a column of icons that I could then link to a CFWindow with the total display. Now, I have to use a Cell Renderer to place the image in the empty column, but first I need the column.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfgridcolumn name=\"Details\" header=\"\" width=\"25\" display=\"true\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAfter that, I create a basic Cell Renderer:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	setDetailButtonRenderer = function(grid,cm,col){\r\n		cm.setRenderer(col,function(value,p,r,ind){\r\n			var retVal = \"<img src=\'/resources/images/icons/book_link.gif\' width=\'16\' height=\'16\' alt=\'Details\' />\";\r\n			return retVal;}\r\n		});\r\n		grid.reconfigure(grid.getDataSource(),cm);\r\n	}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThis didn\'t entirely work out, as it placed the image in every row, even if there wasn\'t a record. So, time to improvise. I adjust to see if there\'s value for a cell in this row\'s \'record\', to determine whether I need the image.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	setDetailButtonRenderer = function(grid,cm,col){\r\n		cm.setRenderer(col,function(value,p,r,ind){\r\n			var ds = grid.getDataSource();\r\n			var theRecord = ds.getAt(ind);\r\n			if(theRecord.get(\'TS\') != null){\r\n				var retVal = \"<img src=\'/resources/images/icons/book_link.gif\' width=\'16\' height=\'16\' alt=\'Details\' />\";\r\n				return retVal;\r\n			}\r\n		});\r\n		grid.reconfigure(grid.getDataSource(),cm);\r\n	}\r\n\r\n	function showRecWin(){\r\n    	ColdFusion.Window.show(\'winDetails\');\r\n    }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAlright, to call the renderer into play I have an init method that is fired by the CF <i>ajaxOnLoad()</i> method.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	init = function(){\r\n		var repGrid = ColdFusion.Grid.getGridObject(\'reportsGrid\');\r\n		var repCM = repGrid.getColumnModel();\r\n\r\n		setDetailButtonRenderer(repGrid,repCM,8);\r\n	}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow we\'re halfway there. Next I need to get a \'click\' on the image cell. You do this by accessing the underlying Ext functions of the Grid object itself, for which you already have a reference (<i>repGrid</i>).\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	init = function(){\r\n		var repGrid = ColdFusion.Grid.getGridObject(\'reportsGrid\');\r\n		var repCM = repGrid.getColumnModel();\r\n\r\n		setDetailButtonRenderer(repGrid,repCM,8);\r\n\r\n		repGrid.on(\'cellclick\',function(grid,rowIndex,columnIndex,e){\r\n			if(columnIndex==8){\r\n				\r\n			}\r\n		});\r\n	}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWe are configuring an on cellclick function here, which is really a listener on the row itself. We further narrow it to only perform action if the column that the cursor was in \'on click\' was our Details column, which is the 9th column of our grid, including hidden columns (remember that this uses a JavaScript array, which starts with zero, so the column you reference is always column count minus one).\r\n\r\nNext thing we need is a quick modal pop-up for our \'Details.\' CFWindow makes a great candidate for this.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfwindow name=\"winDetails\" title=\"Details\" draggable=\"false\" resizable=\"false\" initShow=\"false\" height=\"600\" width=\"600\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIt\'s invisible when initialized, because we only want to show it \'on click\'. We need a quick method for \'showing\' the window.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	function showRecWin(){\r\n    	ColdFusion.Window.show(\'winDetails\');\r\n    }\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWe can now reference this in our \'on click\' function.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	repGrid.on(\'cellclick\',function(grid,rowIndex,columnIndex,e){\r\n		if(columnIndex==8){\r\n			showRecWin();\r\n		}\r\n	});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOK, we get our window, but now we need some data. Now, I could do an ajax call for the data, but it\'s already in my cell. It\'s just too long to easily display in the grid. Rather than do another server call, I\'ll just query the grid\'s Data.Store for the information.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	repGrid.on(\'cellclick\',function(grid,rowIndex,columnIndex,e){\r\n		if(columnIndex==8){\r\n			showRecWin();\r\n			// This empties out any previously displayed content\r\n			document.getElementById(\"winDetails_body\").innerHTML = \"\";\r\n			var ds = grid.getDataSource();\r\n			var theRecord = ds.getAt(rowIndex);\r\n			var valPurpose = theRecord.get(\'FEATUREPURPOSE\');\r\n			var valFunction = theRecord.get(\'FEATUREFUNCTION\');\r\n			document.getElementById(\"winDetails_body\").innerHTML = \"<b>Purpose:</b><br />\" + valPurpose + \"<br /><br /><b>Function:</b><br />\" + valFunction;\r\n		}\r\n	});\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nReally simple, as long as you remember that ColdFusion\'s creation of the grid\'s ColumnModel will uppercase all of your cfgridcolumn\'s <i>name</i> attributes.\r\n\r\nThat\'s it. Really doesn\'t take a whole lot. A little digging in the documentation for the 1.1.1 version of the ExtJS library will give you a ton of information.','2007-11-30 15:14:00',NULL,'CF8-Ajax-Grid-Renderers-and-Events','cutterbl','Default',1,'D:\\sites\\cutterscrossing.com\\subdomains\\blog\\httpdocs\\enclosures/rendererExample.zip',4019,'application/x-zip-compressed',18223,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),
 ('A1751621-3048-71C2-1797293EF0326DD9','CF8 PDF Manipulation: Pulling Text Out','So, this morning a friend called me up with a problem. They had received some PDF files from their insurance company, and they needed the data in Word or Excel for manipulation. Now, they could cut and paste the information, but this was time consuming. She went to the Adobe site, trying to find info, and saw \'ColdFusion\' on the homepage. This sparked her brain, because she immediately went, \"Hey, Cutter does something with ColdFusion! Maybe he can help me!\"\r\n\r\nLucky for her, we now have ColdFusion 8, with it\'s built-in PDF support through the use of the CFPDF tag. I had to do a tiny bit of research on this, because Adobe\'s CF LiveDocs weren\'t overly clear, but I eventually found out that I could extract text with some very simple DDX processing directives.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray</a> did a series of posts recently about working with PDF documents. Although none of them answered my question directly, he had written one about <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2007/7/24/ColdFusion-8-Working-with-PDFs-Part-7\" target=\"_blank\">using the DDX processing directives.</a> This sent me searching the Adobe site for more information, which is where I came upon the <a href=\"http://livedocs.adobe.com/livecycle/es/sdkHelp/programmer/sdkHelp/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=assemblePDFDDX_basics.95.1.html\" target=\"_blank\">Understanding DDX</a> developer documentation. Basically, by rewriting Ray\'s simple example, I was able to extract all of the <i>DocumentText</i> from the PDF and dump it into an XML file. First I need the DDX, which is just some simple XML:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfsavecontent variable=\"myddx\">\r\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\r\n<DDX xmlns=\"http://ns.adobe.com/DDX/1.0/\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://ns.adobe.com/DDX/1.0/ coldfusion_ddx.xsd\">\r\n	<DocumentText result=\"OutXML\">\r\n		<PDF source=\"Title\"/>\r\n	</DocumentText>\r\n</DDX>\r\n</cfsavecontent>\r\n<cfset myddx = trim(myddx)>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThen, I verify the validity:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfif isDDX(myddx)>\r\nyes, its ddx\r\n<cfelse>\r\nno its not\r\n</cfif>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNow, a little explanation. Looking at the DDX, you\'ll notice I\'ve defined a <b>result</b> and a <b>source</b>. I had tried to define my file names here directly, but ColdFusion didn\'t like that when I hit the CFPDF tag. Apparently, when using the <i>processddx</i> action of the tag, you are required to define your <i>inputfiles</i> and <i>outputfiles</i>. Further study of the LiveDocs shows that ColdFusion is expecting structures for these defininitions. So, the DDX references certain structure keys (OutXML and Title) which you must define prior to processing your pdf.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfset inputStruct = StructNew() />\r\n<cfset inputStruct.Title = \"rptLauncher2.pdf\" />\r\n\r\n<cfset outputStruct = StructNew() />\r\n<cfset outputStruct.OutXML = \"words2.xml\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nYou now have all of the necessary pieces. All that\'s required is your call to process your DDX directives.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfpdf action=\"processddx\" ddxfile=\"#myddx#\" name=\"VARIABLES.doc\" inputfiles=\"#inputStruct#\" outputfiles=\"#outputStruct#\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nI CFDump the VARIABLES.doc to see my success or failure, which comes out just fine. I now have a file, words2.xml, sitting in my server\'s folder, which contains all of the content of the PDF file.

Some were in favor of multiple classes, some thought one was enough, a few thought the \"OO Purists\" were creating too much complexity.','2007-12-17 06:16:00','This debate carried over into our office, as it frequently does. Andy Matthews is a co-worker of mine, a very gifted developer with a keen eye towards aesthetics, coming originally from a designer\'s background. That being said, Andy is learning Object Oriented theory right now, having worked primarily in a procedural world in his past, and beleives that frameworks and design patterns are generally overkill. He\'s not a fan of my use of the Active Record pattern, Service Factories, or Remote Proxies, believing that there\'s way too much up-front work involved in what should be relatively simple.\r\n\r\nSome time back (about a year and a half) I began a Data Modeling repository within our system. It was a collection of objects, primarily based around the Active Record pattern, to be used while interacting with various tables within our databases. In the beginning I wrote my own objects, to learn how the process worked and refine and define the concepts within my own development work flow. After I had a better understanding of everything I began to use the <a href=\"http://cfcgenerator.riaforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Illudium PU-36 Code Generator</a>. I was able to modify the XSLT files to create classes that suited our needs (commenting, var scoping, etc.) I don\'t use this library for everything, but it does cover most of my needs very efficiently and effectively.\r\n\r\nWhat I like is the separation of the classes. A bean is nothing more than a data representation of an object, with no logic at all, outside of simple validation. A Data Access Object is nothing more than single record Create - Read - Update - Delete. A Gateway is multi-record access, and a Service Factory is for dealing with collections of related objects. Seem like a lot? Well, it can be. But imagine all of it within a single class. The beauty of working within this sort of paradigm is it\'s separation. When you need a change to logic you go to your controller, and maybe your Service Factory. One record? Check out your bean and your DAO. If you have a change to your db structure it is quite possible to regenerate your base objects and make minor adjustments at the view layer, for added or deleted fields, without having to make sweeping changes all the way through. Why? You\'ve created a consistent model for data access and manipulation.\r\n\r\nWhat I\'ve found, in working on different applications for different clients, is that there have been many places where data access and business objects are replicated in multiple locations of a system. An update to the code would occur in one spot, and was forgotten in another, causing inconsistent results. Providing a common library of access and logic provides consistency and single point adjustment and maintenance. A separation of business objects, according to the task at hand (property access, record access, dataset access, etc.) makes for smaller, trimmer classes that become instantiated into memory only when needed, destroyed when not (if you\'re var scoping properly) and using much less resources than a large, do-it-all type of object. That being said, the objects I\'ve referred to in this post are definitely not the end-all-be-all way of doing things. In fact, although great for simple objects, simple table access, and simple forms, they can be quite convoluted when dealing with very complex objects that model real world objects, rather than a database table (enter the Service Factory). Design patterns are outstanding, and can definitely simplify and speed your development, once you have a grasp of their concepts, but no one pattern suits all needs.\r\n\r\nSo, Andy and I will continue to debate the use of design patterns and frameworks. Peter has decided on <a href=\"http://www.pbell.com/index.cfm/2007/12/14/One-Service-Class-Per-Business-Object--Not-as-Bad-as-You-Think---\" target=\"_blank\">One Service Class Per Business Object</a>, and I\'m quite content to continue to explore new design patterns and frameworks to assist me in my development. It\'s how I do it, I find it to work well for me and the applications that I write, but I adjust as I learn more. That\'s part of the beauty of ColdFusion, you aren\'t nailed down to one way of doing things. With it\'s dynamic typing and OO-like constructs alike, you can have the best of both worlds and code in whatevery style suits your purposes best, and the needs of your client.','The-MultiClass-BO-Debate','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1712,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Sorry I\'m a bit late to get to this, but I\'ve been a little busy with a move, and other fun things. I had the excellent opportunity to preview the 2.0 release in advance, and I have to tell everyone that it is outstanding, a true work of art. The team has gone out of their way to pay attention to community feedback, gather information on the features that were most needed, and writing a truly elegant implementation of this library.','2007-12-17 06:19:00','Many of my readers know that I am a big fan of the library\'s <a href=\"/index.cfm/My-First-ExtJS-DataGrid\" target=\"_blank\">grid components</a>. So, one of the first things I did was take a look at the changes in implementation. I went to the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/playpen/ext-2.0-dev5/examples/\" target=\"_blank\">samples page</a>, and began poking around. One of the first things I hit upon was their <a href=\"http://extjs.com/playpen/ext-2.0-dev5/examples/grid/grid3.html\" target=\"_blank\">plugin samples</a>, specifically the first example which showcased a RowExpander plugin. This worked right on the lines of something I had wanted to do with a recent project, so I dived in head first to get a look under the hood to see what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe example didn\'t include a dynamic dataset, but an array implementation. The contents of the \'expanded row\' were taken from additional value that was \'pushed\' into each record\'s array. This was...OK, but I was looking for a way to dynamically populate this area, and only if and when I needed that drill down capability. Being a plugin, I decided to explore modifying it to serve my own purposes. Basically, I wanted something similar to a cell renderer. I wanted to pass in a new option, remoteMethod, to which I would assign a function reference. Upon row expansion, the area would be prepopulated with a new div, dynamically given an ID, \'rem\' + the row index. After this element was created, the script would then call the referenced function, passing the record and the row index back to the referenced function. From there it was up to me. In my <a href=\"http://examples.cutterscrossing.com/rowexpander\" target=\"_blank\">RowExpander Example</a>, I used <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a> to make an Ajax call to a page, passing it\'s contents back into the dynamically created div element. It\'s a simple example, but one that can definitely be built upon.\r\n\r\nOne of the best things about my example, for me, is that it only takes about 10 lines of additional code (top end) to add the functionality. I am not a JavaScript whiz kid, by any means, but it was very simple to expand upon the framework that was already in place. It goes a long way in showing what a superior job Jack Slocum and the ExtJS crew have done with this latest version of the framework. I only hope that <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> will update the new Ajax components they included in <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/?ogn=EN_US-gntray_prod_coldfusion_home\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 8</a> (most built with ExtJS 1.1) as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nYou can view my <a href=\"http://examples.cutterscrossing.com/rowexpander/\" target=\"_blank\">RowExpander Example</a>, and you can download the sample code from the link below.','ExtJS-20-Extending-The-RowExpander-Plugin','cutterbl','Default',1,'D:\\sites\\cutterscrossing.com\\subdomains\\blog\\httpdocs\\enclosures/rowexpander_example.zip',9849,'application/x-zip-compressed',18408,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

 ('5F4DE5AD-3048-71C2-17B7EC26ECFEC32C','Ask Cutter: Calling functions when paging the CF8 DataGrid','Yesterday, Mischa posted the following comment on my post on <a href=\"/index.cfm/2007/11/30/CF8-Ajax-Grid-Renderers-and-Events\" target=\"_blank\">CF8 Ajax Grid: Renderers and Events</a>:\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\nHi Steve, thank you for this example and your explanation! Do I understand correctly that init will fire once? Is there a way to fire init or any other function when the user pages through the grid using the page forward button?\r\nThanks!\r\nMischa.\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nGreat question! Yes, to my knowledge the init() method is only called once. And, chances are, you really want it to only be called once. However, when the grid is initialized, and on every paging request, the data store runs it\'s load() method. The data store object, one of the underlying <a href=\"http://extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS</a> pieces of the data grid, has a publicly available event that you can listen for, \'load\'. I would go something like this.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nreportGrid = function(){\r\n	grid = ColdFusion.Grid.getGridObject(\'reportsGrid\');\r\n	cm = grid.getColumnModel();\r\n	ds = grid.getDataSource();\r\n	cm.setRenderer(2,redBold);\r\n\r\n     	var gridHead = grid.getView().getHeaderPanel(true);\r\n    var tb = new Ext.Toolbar(gridHead, [{\r\n        text: \'Add Art\',\r\n        handler : showRecWin\r\n    }]);\r\n\r\n	grid.reconfigure(ds,cm);\r\n\r\n	ds.on(\'load\',function(){alert(\'it just loaded the Data Store\')});\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nIt\'s that last line that\'s the kicker. What I\'ve done here is used the data store\'s on() method to assign an Event Listener to the \'load\' event, with my own custom function. This will now kick off with whenever the data store calls the load() method, which happens on initialization, as well as each paging request (forwards or backwards).\r\n\r\nThere is a wealth of available knowledge, for interacting with these components, that is available in the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-1.1.1/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS 1.1 API documentation</a>.

There are a lot of fantastic changes and additions here, but I did run into one or two snags. In a previous post I showed how to use <a href=\"/index.cfm/2007/11/30/CF8-Ajax-Grid-Renderers-and-Events\" target=\"_blank\">Event Handlers and Item Renderers</a> with the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/?ogn=EN_US-gntray_prod_coldfusion_home\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 8</a> Ajax implementation of the ExtJS 1.1.1 data grid. It works very similarly with a straight (non-CF) implementation, whereby I had defined an unbound column, in my ColumnModel, and applied a renderer to it so that an icon would appear with an onclick event attached to the cell click. It\'s a very straight forward process, that immediately broke with the 2.0 library. It took me a little bit of playing around, but I finally discovered what appears to be either a bug in the library, or a glitch in the documentation.\r\n\r\nWhat made this column previously \'unbound\' was the fact that no dataIndex was set to the column. It wasn\'t required. Acoording to the 2.0 documentation, the attribute is still supposed to be optional. However, when trying this with 2.0, I found that I would continually get an error. Only after duplicating my dataIndex (I applied my ID query column to the dataIndex, the same as my ID column), and then using the renderer to overwrite, did I finally get my working grid. It\'s a bit of a hack, but it did the job.\r\n\r\nIt\'s a small gotcha, but a gotcha none the less, so I wanted to let ya\'ll know. As I said before, there are some fantastic changes in the new 2.0 implementation, and already some nice plugins being developed by the community.

But i am not really getting anywhere \r\n(hopelessly bamboozled) with the records returned figure....\"\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\nThis is a great question! And so easy to implement using the underlying <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/ext-1.1.1/docs/\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS 1.1.1</a> component architecture of the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/?ogn=EN_US-gntray_prod_coldfusion_home\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 8</a> Ajax controls. The grid component already knows what the beginning and ending rows are for the page, and the total number of rows, so it\'s just a matter of getting them to display on the PagingToolbar. Paul had included a little code in his post, the primary piece of which (as far as we\'re concerned) is his formatgrid() function:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nformatgrid = function() {\r\n    mygrid = ColdFusion.Grid.getGridObject(\'ad\');\r\n   \r\n    cm = mygrid.getColumnModel();\r\n    cm.setRenderer(3,myf);\r\n    cm.setRenderer(5,myf);\r\n   \r\n    mygrid.reconfigure(mygrid.getDataSource(),cm);\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nBasically he has most of the pieces that he needs already. He needs a reference to his data.Store object, which we\'ll add right after he gets his grid instance:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	...\r\n	mygrid = ColdFusion.Grid.getGridObject(\'ad\');\r\n	ds = mygrid.getDataSource();\r\n	...\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThen, after his renderers, but before his <em>reconfigure()</em>, we\'ll get a reference to his grid\'s FooterPanel to redefine the PagingToolbar:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n	...\r\n	cm.setRenderer(5,myf);\r\n	// Get the Footer\r\n\r\n	var gridFoot = mygrid.getView().getFooterPanel(true);\r\n	// Create a new Paging Toolbar\r\n\r\n	var paging = new Ext.PagingToolbar(gridFoot,ds,{\r\n		pageSize:25, //number of records displayed in grid\r\n\r\n		displayInfo:true,\r\n		displayMsg:\'Displaying records {0} - {1} of {2}\',\r\n		emptyMsg:\"No records to display\"\r\n	});\r\n	\r\n	// reconfigure the grid\r\n\r\n	mygrid.reconfigure(ds,cm);\r\n	...\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nHey! Reload the page and what do you get? An adjusted toolbar, giving Paul exactly what he was looking for, the current record from - to and the total number of records returned.

Especially when dealing with simple forms that deal with a single record within a table (go figure). It\'s also really handy if you\'re utilizing something like <a href=\"http://cfcgenerator.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">The Illudium PU-36 Code Generator</a> to auto-generate your data modeling. But, occasionally, you hit a glitch and need to rethink.','2008-02-04 21:31:00','One of the great things about working where I do is that we have two full-time database administrators. These guys are nothing but head-on experts in SQL, specifically <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/sql/default.mspx\" target=\"_blank\">MS SQL</a>. That is their sole mission, to monitor and refine our SQL processes. Now, we have a lot of strictly SQL side processes that churn through data all day long, but these guys also watch SQL threads being processed, identify issues in various execution plans, and assist our entire development team in learning to write better SQL within our code. Now, none of our guys are slouches at SQL anyway. They can all write fairly complex query statements, stored procedures, and manage transactions, but sometimes things come up that it\'s nice to have a specialist\'s eyes.\r\n\r\nThe other day I ran into just this type of issue. I had a very vanilla row object, just four data fields, two of which formed the table\'s unique key. Now, the DAOs, created by Illudium, have a simple <em>save()</em> method. It takes a bean object, passes it to an <em>exists()</em> method, which in turn queries the database to find out if a record already exists with the keys identified in the bean. If the record doesn\'t exist it will return false, to which the <em>exists()</em> method will then pass the bean into a <em>create()</em> method. If the record does exist then the <em>exists()</em> method will pass the bean to an <em>update()</em> method. All pretty simple and straightforward. I\'ve seen several different ways of writing the Active Record pattern, and many of them have some permutation of this action, either in the DAO or the Gateway. My problem, though, is that I was getting cfquery timeouts, for no true apparent reason. So, I called in John to look at it with me.\r\n\r\nNow, I\'ll start this with saying that there wasn\'t anything wrong with the code the way it had been generated. Everything should have functioned as planned. In fact my process was looping over a large structure to insert or update records in the database, and the <em>exists()</em> method\'s query was only timing out about once in 1900 records. But it was erroring, so I asked for a specialist. I showed my code to John, explained exactly what was happening with each record iteration, and John said \"Why are you doing all of this? Why don\'t you just write an Upsert?\" <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upsert\" target=\"_blank\">What\'s an Upsert?</a> Well, what does it sound like? An Upsert is a single query block which will update an existing record if it\'s found, or create a new record if not. And it is ridiculously easy:\r\n	\r\n	<code>\r\n		<cfset var updQ = \"\" />\r\n		<cftry>\r\n			<cfquery name=\"updQ\" datasource=\"#APPLICATION.dsn#\">\r\n				UPDATE 	dbo.tblATrack\r\n				SET		tsLast = <cfqueryparam value=\"#CreateODBCDateTime(ARGUMENTS.aTrack.gettsLast())#\" cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_timestamp\" />\r\n				WHERE	intAID = <cfqueryparam value=\"#ARGUMENTS.aTrack.getintAID()#\" CFSQLType=\"cf_sql_integer\" />\r\n				AND		chServer = <cfqueryparam value=\"#ARGUMENTS.aTrack.getchServer()#\" cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_char\" maxlength=\"2\" />\r\n\r\n				IF @@rowcount = 0\r\n					BEGIN\r\n						INSERT INTO dbo.tblATrack (\r\n							tsStart,\r\n							intAID,\r\n							tsLast,\r\n							chServer )\r\n						VALUES (\r\n							<cfqueryparam value=\"#CreateODBCDateTime(ARGUMENTS.aTrack.gettsStart())#\" CFSQLType=\"cf_sql_timestamp\" />,\r\n							<cfqueryparam value=\"#ARGUMENTS.aTrack.getintAID()#\" CFSQLType=\"cf_sql_integer\" />,\r\n							<cfqueryparam value=\"#CreateODBCDateTime(ARGUMENTS.aTrack.gettsLast())#\" CFSQLType=\"cf_sql_timestamp\" />,\r\n							<cfqueryparam value=\"#ARGUMENTS.aTrack.getchServer()#\" cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_char\" maxlength=\"2\" /> )\r\n					END\r\n			</cfquery>\r\n			<cfcatch type=\"database\">\r\n				<!--- Error Handler Here --->\r\n			</cfcatch>\r\n		</cftry>\r\n	</code>\r\n\r\nMan, I love these guys. I went from three methods [<em>save()</em> - <em>exists()</em> - <em>update()</em>/<em>create()</em>] with two separate hits to the database server, to a single, simple <em>save()</em> method with one hit to the database server. Now, this code is specific to MS SQL, but I would be surprised if <a href=\"http://www.mysql.com\" target=\"_blank\">MySQL</a>, <a href=\"http://www.oracle.com\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.postgresql.org\" target=\"_blank\">PostgreSQL</a> didn\'t have similar processes to draw from (if you know the answer to that please post it below). Now I\'ll have to adjust Illudium\'s XSLT doc for the DAO creation, but this can save quite a bit of overhead in certain circumstances.\r\n\r\nThis might\'ve been old hat to some of my readers out there, but I thought it worth sharing for those who are like I was. Those who didn\'t know. I hope this nugget helps someone. If so, feel free to comment.','SQL-Tricks-Whats-an-Upsert','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',9383,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL);

A debate goes on about code \"structure\". To indent? Or not indent? One argument persists that unnecessary spaces/tabs within code increase the bandwidth used by our systems, serving up \'empty\' content. The other argument is that this cost is minimal, in comparison to the time savings with relation to maintaining \'readable\' code.','2008-02-20 17:47:00','Our official position is that the maintainability of code is more important. At some juncture, in the future, we may implement other methods for reducing the \'space\', possibly eliminating it during the Ant build process during deployment. For now it is more important to be able to quickly scan code, find items for clarification or change, and accomplish our mission.\r\n\r\nProper indentation of code does assist in the maintainability of the code, and should be applied regardless of the language being used (XHTML, ActionScript, JavaScript, SQL, ColdFusion, etc.) Indentation should be applied to logical blocks of code within a document. The following are a few different examples:\r\n\r\nColdFusion CFC:\r\n<code>\r\n<!---\r\n *====================================================================================\r\n *	TEMPLATE/CLASS\r\n *	com.DM.testObj\r\n *\r\n *	PURPOSE\r\n *	Just a test object\r\n *\r\n *	AUTHOR\r\n *	Stephen G. \'Cutter\' Blades, Jr. [SGB] sbladesATmycompanyDOTcom\r\n *\r\n *	COPYRIGHT\r\n *	MyCompany (c) 2008, All Rights Reserved\r\n *\r\n *	NOTES\r\n *************************************************************************************\r\n *	SGB [02.20.2008]\r\n *	Initial file creation.\r\n *	Dependencies:\r\n *		com.DM.superObj\r\n *	Dependent Objects:\r\n *		com.DM.subObj\r\n *====================================================================================\r\n --->\r\n<cfcomponent displayname=\"testObj\" extends=\"superObj\" output=\"false\">\r\n\r\n	<!--- Some props --->\r\n	<cfset VARIABLES.instance = StructNew() />\r\n	\r\n	<cffunction name=\"Init\" output=\"false\" returntype=\"testObj\" access=\"public\">\r\n		<cfargument name=\"objID\" type=\"numeric\" required=\"false\" default=\"0\" />\r\n		<cfargument name=\"objName\" type=\"string\" required=\"false\" default=\"\" />\r\n		<cfargument name=\"dtCreated\" type=\"date\" required=\"false\" default=\"#Now()#\" />\r\n		<cfset var iItem = 0 />\r\n		<cfloop collection=\"#ARGUMENTS#\" item=\"iItem\">\r\n			<cfset Set(iItem,ARGUMENTS[iItem]) />\r\n		</cfloop>\r\n		<cfreturn THIS />\r\n	</cffunction>\r\n\r\n</cfcomponent>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nMost documents, of any type, will have very similar, base level code stylization.

We start with the standard comment header, come to some processing directives, then get into actual output. The entire document is wrapped within a &lt;cfsetting&gt; tagset. These tags, at the beginning and end of the document, are open (or self-closing) tags, the first stating that any document content after the tag should only be displayed if it is within an explicit output block (either &lt;cfoutput&gt; or a WriteOutput() statement). The second &lt;cfsetting&gt; tag opens the document for non-explicit output, in case this template is <em>included</em> inside another document. By usinging the <em>enablecfoutputonly</em> attribute, the server will reduce the amount of whitespace rendered in the XHTML passed to the browser. Another tool for this is the use of the &lt;cfsilent&gt; tags. Here they are wrapped around a multi-line ColdFusion comment, which would be processed as whitespace to the XHTML document (The above example is for example use only. The above comment would have typically been outside the &lt;cfoutput&gt; altogether). By using the &lt;cfsilent&gt; tags around this, we eliminate that whitespace generation. These tags are also handy if you require a processing block in the middle of your output, as it will hide the whitespace that processing block would produce.\r\n\r\nThe example above also shows that there are times when you should, and should not, indent. With ColdFusion, JavaScript, ActionScript, etc., simple conditional output (if this then \"ok\") will typically be inline, while more complex conditional output will be indented as normal. Any looping conditionals will be indented. There are examples above for both tag based, and simple scripted programming.\r\n\r\nOur next post will be part II of this topic, where we will show more examples covering XHTML, script, and SQL examples.','Guidelines-Code-Readability--Pt1','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2723,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

Last week we actually set up one ColdFusion 8 instance within production, to place inside our load balanced environment, to judge true application performance under load. During the setup, and before placing it into the mix, I use the localhost hosts file to direct specific sites to the localhost for testing. This has always been helpful in the past, and this time was no exception. We fired up the services, hit one of the sites, and it all promptly broke.','2008-03-11 12:41:00','There\'s nothing like a ColdFusion Error on your very first server page load. It\'s always best to get trouble out of the way right up front, rather than a creeping issue down the line. This particular error was really interesting, in that it had never shown up within our development environment, making it very unique.\r\n\r\nI had a pretty good idea ahead of time, but I turned on Robust Exception Information to get the full skinny. We have a template, that runs only in production, that runs a &lt;cfexecute&gt; tag to allow certain resources. This has an encrypted value, pulled from the database, that uses the <em>Decrypt()</em> function, with the value originally encrypted using the <em>Encrypt()</em> function on a ColdFusion MX 6.1 server, many moons ago. We did not have an issue with this under ColdFusion MX 7, so this was a little perplexing. I pulled up the ColdFusion 8 function documentation, so that I could review the required arguments, but I could not find anything there to answer why the code was giving me an error.\r\n\r\nOK, so now it was time to experiment a little. I pulled up the documentation on the <em>Decrypt()</em> function for versions 6.1, 7, and 8. Versions 7 and 8 both had needed encryption improvements, bringing new arguments to the function. The 7 and 8 documentation both said that the new arguments were optional, and for 7 that appeared to be the case, but with 8 I was going to have to play a little. The first thing I noticed was the new <em>algorithm</em> argument, which was supposed to default to <em>CFMX_COMPAT</em> (three guesses what that means). I tried this argument on my 8 configuration, to no avail. I then read further, concentrating on the <em>encoding</em> argument. <em>IVorSalt</em> and <em>iterations</em> are two other possible arguments, but I couldn\'t see either of these applying to a value encrypted using 6.1.\r\n\r\nNot knowing which encoding was applied through the default 6.1 <em>Encrypt()</em>, I decided to apply more time to the <em>encoding</em> argument, I decided to try some of the values to see what might work. I tried <em>Binary</em> first, but still received the error. Next I tried <em>Hex</em>, which finally gave me success. In the end my statement look something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfset VARIABLES.pass = Decrypt(VARIABLES.qGet.password,VARIABLES.qGet.key,\'CFMX_COMPAT\',\'Hex\') />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nMaybe, if the value had been encrypted with ColdFusion 7, it might not have required the additional arguments. But, since it had been encrypted using 6.1, it was necessary to clarify for ColdFusion exactly what was needed.

His \"most interesting bit\" was the idea that <a href=\"http://warpspire.com/tipsresources/programming/scaling-is-for-nerds/\" target=\"_blank\">Scaling is for nerds</a>. Basically, while listening to some side chatter from <a href=\"http://www.felocity.org\" target=\"_blank\">Jakob Heuser</a>, a speaker at the conference, he (Kyle) came away with the idea <em>\"...don\'t worry about scaling -- scaling is for nerds. By the time you hit pain points, you can bring in someone who really knows what they\'re doing. Most importantly, by the time you hit pain points, you should be profitable enough to not worry about bringing in someone who knows what they\'re doing.\"</em> Now, something is a little out of context, as Jakob\'s topic, \"Scalability Boot Camp,\" is on horizontal scalability, according to a recent post to his blog.\r\n\r\nMy first thought is \"I hope this guy Kyle never writes anything in ColdFusion.\" It\'s not that we couldn\'t use some developers, my phone is ringing constantly with recruiters looking for good talent. No, I just think that ColdFusion developers need to have a better mindset than this guy. Part of being a good developer is thinking about your application\'s scalability, performance, and extensability. To blatantly ignore any of these during your development is to invite future disaster, creating a lot of additional work somewhere along the way. Even if your application might start off with only 10 users on initial product launch, you should attempt to design it as if it will be used by thousands, or more, at a time. This also helps to avoid utilizing the <a href=\"http://www.laputan.org/mud/\" target=\"_blank\">Big Ball of Mud</a> design pattern, because eventually it won\'t stick to the wall anymore.\r\n\r\nThe scary thing is, this guy has been around a while. He\'s been working on the web for some time, he has a seemingly well trafficed site, and some N00b out there will read what he\'s said and take it to heart. To write an application, knowing that someone else will probably have to rewrite it down the line because you were to lazy to do it right the first time, is wrong. Not knowing any better is one thing, we all learn and grow every day. Doing it with full knowledge, on the other hand, is just irresponsible.\r\n\r\nI hope I\'ve read it wrong, and I hope you, dear reader, know better.','2008-03-18 15:55:00',NULL,'Code-For-Scalability','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1954,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

It appears that an AIR app which uses the FDMSBridge.swf provided by Adobe WILL NOT work when the app has transparency.\r\n\r\nIn my sample app\r\n-----------------\r\n1) I opened my sample code (without transparency), and compiled it.\r\n2) I pushed a message to the gateway and the message was successfully received in the app.\r\n3) I then changed the transparency setting in the App.xml file from false to true and recompiled the app.\r\n4) I pushed another message to the gateway and received nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the final app\r\n---------------------------------------------\r\n1) Transparency was already set to true, so I compiled the app\r\n2) I pushed a message to the gateway, and received nothing.\r\n3) I then changed transparency to false, recompiled the app\r\n4) Pushed a message and successfully received it.\r\n\r\nFurther, when the app first loads, it correctly displays the alert window when transparency is set to false, but not when it\'s set to true.\r\n------------------------\r\nHere\'s a small code sample:\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nFDMSLibrary.load(\"FDMSBridge.swf\", initBlazeDSCode);\r\n \r\nfunction initBlazeDSCode() {\r\n alert(\'why me\');\r\n var cs = new ChannelSet();\r\n cs.addChannel(new AMFChannel(\"cf-polling-amf\",\"http://domainname.com/flex2gateway/cfamfpolling\"));\r\n consumer = new Consumer();\r\n consumer.setDestination(\"ColdFusionGateway\");\r\n consumer.addEventListener(\"message\", messageHandler);\r\n consumer.setChannelSet(cs);\r\n consumer.subscribe();\r\n}\r\n \r\nfunction messageHandler(e) {\r\n alert(\'got a message!

The language really has changed since the days I was heavier into it (1998 thru 2001, maybe), so it\'s great to see how much it has grown. I feel like I\'ve been ignoring an old friend.','2008-05-05 23:51:00','One of the great things, now, are these incredible libraries for crossbrowser DOM manipulation and extended display components, like <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a> and <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS</a>. I\'m using both quite a bit, and really like not having to fight with browser incompatibility (most of the time). I use JQuery for most DOM manipulation tasks, while using Ext for it\'s extensive, and consistent, component set.\r\n\r\nExt components use data \'Store\'s to populate many of their objects, such as combo boxes, data grids, and the like. Ext provides a number of \'Store\' types, and \'reader\'s for parsing through them. Basically, you can provide simple arrays, XML, or Json to create a \'Store\', which is a collection of individual records. When dealing with Ajax calls, XML can get heavy, but Json can be pulled natively from ColdFusion functions, just by including \"returnformat=json\" to your requests. The problem, though, is that the existing JsonStore object, within Ext, can\'t read the return in the format that ColdFusion provides.\r\n\r\nNow, you know this <em>has</em> to work somehow. After all, ColdFusion 8\'s built in components are all Ext 1.1, so there must be some way. Well, I don\'t know what CF is doin\' under the hood, but a quick trip to Google showed that someone else had already dealt with this issue, and parked a solution right on the Ext Forums. <a href=\"http://ideamill.synaptrixgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">John (Daemach) Wilson</a> wrote a custom extension to the base Store \'reader\' object.\r\n\r\nJohn\'s implementation required the developer to use the <em>QueryConvertForGrid()</em> method on your function returns, but I like to repurpose code as much as I can. I modified John\'s code, just slightly, to allow for a basic \"returnformat=json\" type of call (or the QueryConvertForGrid() method, if you want it).

I was asked to speak at WebManiacs, which was my first conference speaking engagement, and although my session was somewhat small (last session that day), I had a great group who seemed to really enjoy my presentation, with a lot of questions, comments, and discussion afterwards. All in all a lot of fun. That being said, the conference was... lacking a little. Now, in all fairness, it was the first of it\'s kind, the first for <a href=\"http://www.figleaf.com/\" target=\"_blank\">FigLeaf</a> (of this size), and a learning experience for everyone involved.','2008-06-03 16:28:00','<h2>Quick Rundown</h2>\r\n\r\nIt was an honor to be asked to speak at this conference. The list of speakers was impressive, and the breadth of the subject matter appeared to state a great, high end Adobe developers conference. What wasn\'t apparent was the level of sessions being run. On the face, it looked like there would be some very nice advanced tracks in multiple disciplines. In reality, most attendees came away feeling as if the material was overly introductory. What was the true target audience of the conference? Was it catering to advanced developers? Or was it more geared to those just entering the field? In this respect, the lines were really blurry. It has to be hard to peg this down, when two topics of major focus (<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/?promoid=BPDEQ\" target=\"_blank\">Flex</a> and <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/air/\" target=\"_blank\">AIR</a>) are still mostly new disciplines. Flex has been around for a while, but has changed significantly since the 1.0-1.5 days. AIR is extremely new, but the majority of AIR development involves disciplines that web developers are typically already familiar with. My experience with Flex is very limited, so I got a lot out of my hands on session with Dave Watts (who I\'ve known for a while on <a href=\"http://www.houseoffusion.com/groups/cf-talk/\" target=\"_blank\">CF-Talk</a>, and is a great teacher), as well as my session with <a href=\"http://www.simonfree.com\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Free</a>, who was a great last minute stand in for <a href=\"http://www.horwith.com\" target=\"_blank\">Simon Horwith</a> (who had to stay at the office with a project). Both of these session were very introductory, which is what I needed. There were other sessions, however, that I thought would be more advanced than they were. I wasn\'t alone in this perception.\r\n\r\n <h2>What Do You Want?</h2>\r\n\r\nI can never claim that I know everything about ColdFusion, or even programming as a whole. But, I have been doing this for a while. With the exception of some of the newer features of ColdFusion 8 (like the session I held on ColdFusion 8 Ajax and Extending Through ExtJS), and things like reports and graphing, there really isn\'t much in ColdFusion that I haven\'t learned in the last eight years of development. I\'ve experimented with most of the major frameworks, dabbled in code generation, done heavy reading and experimentation with the JVM configs, and I\'m pretty proficient in scoping my vars and writing CFCs. What does a conference hold for a developer at my level? Well, this one didn\'t have a lot, to be honest. I guess that\'s what I meant by \"What\'s the target audience?\"\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the difference between WebManiacs and <a href=\"http://www.cfunited.com\" target=\"_blank\">CFUnited</a> was a heavier focus on Flex and AIR. But, you could get those same sessions out of 360 Flex or Adobe MAX, given their introductory nature, so what really makes it different? Overwhelmingly it was agreed that next year FigLeaf would need to place a scale (beginner, intermediate, advanced) on sessions, and I\'m fairly sure FigLeaf got that message. What I would like to see is a higher focus for advanced developers. Along with it\'s introductory tracks, I\'d love to see some advanced hands on tracks for developing with the major frameworks. I had a lot of people asking me about using <a href=\"http://www.coldspringframework.org\" target=\"_blank\">ColdSpring</a>\'s advanced features, like auto generation of <a href=\"http://coldspringframework.org/docs/Developing_w__ColdSpring.htm#Remote_Facades\" target=\"_blank\">RemoteProxy</a> objects. I also heard a lot of folks asking about JVM tuning, and JRun configuration, as well as server virtualization. These are the types of things we get into once we\'re way past mastering <em>cfloop</em> and <em>cfquery</em>, and the type of knowledge developers crave to get to the next level. How does one truly configure for localized development? Configure and use ISAPI re-write on different platforms for SES Urls? Advanced <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache</a> configuration? How does one define Business Process Models for their applications? How do you begin using <a href=\"http://subversion.tigris.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Subversion</a>? How can <a href=\"http://ant.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Ant</a> assist your development cycle? How do you plan architecture for a high-traffic, high-availability application? When does it make sense to do code refactoring? What are some of the most common (and not so common) design patterns, and what scenarios make best for their use? How do you track down an apparent memory leak within your application?\r\n\r\n<h2>OK, What Else?</h2>\r\n\r\nBeing my first conference gig, and in my nervousnous, I went through my slide presentation pretty quickly. Luckily I had a little sample app I had written for my presenetation, giving me plenty of sample code to show, explain, and answer questions on. In the end this was a really good thing, because that\'s what people really wanted to see, the code. I attended on session on Integrating Flex with <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/?promoid=BPDEO\" target=\"_blank\">Live Cycle</a>, in which I had to leave five minutes early to take a call from the office, but during my stay in the presentation the presenter didn\'t show one line of code. He wasn\'t the only one, and it was a comment I heard from a lot of the attendees. Most attendees were attending a session for which they already had some basic knowledge. What they were search of were concrete code examples, with detailed explanations, to reinforce what they already knew (letting them know they were doing it the right way), or to show them something new to them. It\'s a hard thing to do in a 50 minute presentation, but it\'s better than reading off the slides we can all download after the conference.\r\n\r\n<h2>Can A Conference Further Our Community?</h2>\r\n\r\nI was bouncing an idea off Simon Free one day over lunch. Speaking at this conference were some of the biggest names in the ColdFusion Community: <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Camden</a>, <a href=\"http://carehart.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Charlie Arehart</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mattwoodward.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">Matt Woodward</a>, <a href=\"http://www.pbell.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Peter Bell</a>, <a href=\"http://numtopia.com/terry\" target=\"_blank\">Terrance Ryan</a>, <a href=\"http://alagad.com/go/blog?createdBy=dhughes\" target=\"_blank\">Doug Hughes</a>, and many more (sorry if you weren\'t listed, but the list is extensive). With so much talent in the room, can\'t we put it to use? One of the big complaints I hear, about ColdFusion (in comparison to something like PHP, for instance), is the lack (or that perception) of complete enterprise level Open Source projects. No <a href=\"http://www.joomla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Joomla</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.drupal.org\" target=\"_blank\">Drupal</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.oscommerce.com\" target=\"_blank\">OSCommerce</a>, or <a href=\"http://www.phpbb.com\" target=\"_blank\">PHPBB</a>, or whatever. How cool would it be to watch and listen to some of these guys pick a project and plan it out. A two hour power session, where you watch the initial steps of project planning, definition of business process, outlining what the project should and shouldn\'t do (and why). There\'s no way it could be completely scoped in that short time frame, but imagine a session like this in the beginning of day one of a conference. All the notes get added to an online whiteboard, then people could contribute input, libraries, and pseudocode throughout the conference. Maybe, just maybe, people commit to the project by the time the conference ends, with a roadmap for the development of the project.\r\n\r\n<h2>Moving Forward</h2>\r\n\r\nI think FigLeaf is taking all feedback very seriously. And I don\'t want folks to get the wrong impression, I took away some great things from WebManiacs. I spent some time learning about PDF creation and manipulation. We learned, without a doubt, that <a href=\"http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/blazeds/BlazeDS\" target=\"_blank\">BlazeDS</a> does not do true push via <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Messaging_Protocol\" target=\"_blank\">RTMP</a> (that was a revelation). With my limited knowledge of Flex, I was pleased to learn how similar it is to working with <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJs</a>, in relation to it\'s component architecture and event driven model. I attended a fantastic session on scalability from <a href=\"http://jochem.vandieten.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Jochem Van Dieten</a>. I learned that internationalization is about much more than just a character set. I intentionally sat in on all of the frameworks intros to assess which might best serve our next generation apps (and learned that I still dislike <a href=\"http://www.fusebox.org\" target=\"_blank\">Fusebox</a>, but that\'s just me). I also got to meet a bunch of people who I\'ve only emailed back and forth with for years, as well as talk to a few of my readers. Those conversations were the biggest take away.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been a bit swamped with our datacenter migration project, but hopefully I\'ll get the opportunity to post my session slides and sample app sometime next week.

 ('B3724CF2-3048-71C2-176FFB7530FCDC05','Build Applications That Scale','For over two months now, we\'ve been preparing to migrate our services to a new datacenter. This has been, without a doubt, the most important project within the history of our company, for a number of reasons. We sell, host, and support websites for a single vertical market. A few thousand sites, all operating off a single shared framework/codebase. This is up from the few hundred sites we were hosting when I joined the company almost three years back. Our sites have been a testament to the power of the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> server platform, and I thought it important to share with you all the importance of our move, the challenges we overcame, and the benefits we\'ve incurred.\r\n\r\nI want to give you a little background here, so that you\'ll have an understanding on the history and growth of our application, and how critical it is to think in terms of scale. In talking with several developers, while at WebManiacs, I was surprised to find out just how many had come across similar issues at one time or another.','2008-06-22 23:09:00','<h2>Humble Beginnings</h2>\r\n\r\nEight years ago, our company was started by a few sales guys. They had an idea, ran with it, and got some great results. Being tied to a single vertical market, they needed a way to produce sites that were highly customized, with a few key applications, but had a consistent underlying architecture. They contracted a company to build for them a framework, a system of interfaces where these sales guys could enter in some details and the framework would generate the \'bones\' of a site for a client, something that could then be customized with graphics and data, all input through web based interfaces. What they built was basically a market specific Content Management System, complete with custom theme uploaders, navigation and page editors, a user management system, the works. For it\'s time (circa ColdFusion 4.0/4.5 with an <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">MS Excel</a> spreadsheet for a database) the system was great. The company didn\'t need to hire any HTML coders, just a few graphics/Flash guys and data entry people to help customize sites.\r\n\r\nAs time went on, the company needed to add new applications and features to the system. The contractors that had built the original framework had long since been let go. One of the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/flash/\" target=\"_blank\">Flash</a> designers was ambitious enough to pick up a book and teach himself ColdFusion. After a while it was obvious that Access wasn\'t going to sustain their growth, so the same designer picked up a book on <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/sqlserver/2008/en/us/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">MS SQL Server</a> (they had already upgraded from Excel to <a href=\"http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/access/default.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Access</a> by this point) and began that transition. Growth was quick, and staffing low, so new applications and features were written quickly, hobbled together with the existing framework, tested to \'work\', and put to market. Systems were added, and finally moved out of a a hosting facility and moved to a datacenter downtown. The server platforms were upgraded to ColdFusion 6.1. Multi-talented developers were added to our development staff, writing Flash based applications using FlashRemoting with the relatively new ColdFusion Components. The system grew.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Issues At Hand</h2>\r\n\r\nAfter several years of \"<a href=\"http://www.laputan.org/mud/\" target=\"_blank\">throwing the mud against the wall and praying it will stick</a>,\" the initial framework was nearly nonexistent and the codebase had expanded to several thousand templates of double conditionals and unscoped variables, with includes nested ten levels deep and SELECT * everywhere. Four or five different ColdFusion developers, each with varying degrees of skill (or lack thereof, depending on the individual) had contributed to the codebase, and only sub-applications written in the last three to four years had a modular design, well written SQL statements, and properly scoped variables. Each domain created a separate application on the server, with it\'s own set of APPLICATION or SESSION variables controlling application flow. As more clients came on, system resources would dwindle, but ColdFusion kept chugging away. Additional servers were added, and a load balancer to spread the wealth. The clients kept coming, and so did their users. A separate SQL Server was added just to track and report on user statistics. Growth was incredible.\r\n\r\nGrowth was also debilitating. A terrific challenge to overcome, from a business perspective, is to grow as a business beyond your infrastructure\'s capacity to sustain it. As time progressed, it became obvious (quickly) that changes would be required to continue to support our growth. The rack was a mess of wires and outdated equipment, and the time had come to have more up-to-date equipment that was prepared to scale. On top of this, due to a number of issues we had eventually begun to run our systems on top of a web platform running on multiple versions of ColdFusion, which needed to be standardized on to a single platform.\r\n\r\nPlanning a wholesale upgrade to systems architecture can be daunting. Not only are you evaluating the necessary components to remain running, you also have to pad for the needs of growth and scale. Months are spent identifying the best server resources for the task, designing the network infrastructure, and determining the technologies that will be placed in play. After this (when owned by a higher corporate entity) you also have to write justifications for your decisions, strong immutable arguments that will get you what you need from those who don\'t truly know what your needs are.<!--- In this type of situation, never assume that the parent corporation has any belief in your abilities to know your systems and applications well enough to make these decisions on your own. ---> This process can take three times as long as the initial planning, with seemingly endless rounds of justification documentation, and technology can, and does, change during this process. That means that adjustments are made to your initial architecture plans, and testing of new technologies must be completed to ensure they are the right \'fit\' for your company\'s needs.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, we kept getting new clients, a greater number of users, and quickly began to feel the strain on our application performance. ColdFusion\'s JVM utilization began to build throughout the day, as more and more traffic came in. The SQL server was working overtime to process the tons of requests, and page response time began to lag. Clients started calling, support tickets went up, and you have to deal with it. Now you start to seriously review your applications. With a few thousand templates of code, only a small percentage of which had been refactored in the past few years, it was time to really deep dive internal storage mechanisms. Where are the bottlenecks? We moved dozen of variables from the SESSION scope into the APPLICATION scope. We moved variables from the APPLICATION scope into to SERVER scope. We var scoped every \'object\' (read: CFC) within our codebase. There were nice gains, but traffic continued to increase. Then we spent time learning JVM tuning. I learned more about JRun in a nine month period than I ever thought I would need to know. Growth <em>can</em> be debilitating.\r\n\r\n<h2>The Big Switch</h2>\r\n\r\nAfter months of planning, cajoling, mounting, and testing, our new systems were finally in-place and ready to \"go live.\" We were moving from a multi-version ColdFusion platform (6.1, 7, and 8) to ColdFusion 8.0.1 with all hotfixes. We were moving from SQL 2000 Standard to SQL 2005 Enterprise. We were moving from direct attached storage to a SAN. And we were moving into virtualization. Drastic changes in architecture, but built for us to succeed and scale. After days (and nights) of final load testing the day was finally upon us. We flipped the switch, changing the DNS settings of our client sites to point to our new systems, and watched as traffic slowly switched from one facility to another.\r\n\r\nOver two weeks have passed. There were minor initial hurdles, typically related to changes in network topology or file system permissions, but overall everything has gone very smooth (knock on wood). One of the greatest indicators to date has been the JVM performance. Our code barely changed between facilities, with only minor changes to accommodate changes in network topology, but JVM performance has improved by large numbers. In fact, the overall performance gains have been pretty outstanding. Currently we can only attribute this to better equipment, and the switch to SQL 2005 Enterprise (which is smokin\' fast!). Don\'t ever let anyone tell you that your application\'s performance isn\'t tied to your database tier. Now we\'re stepping out of \'firefighter\' mode, and back to the task of product improvement and enhancement and new application development. It will be good to work in CFEclipse again, writing code, rather than staring at <a href=\"http://www.fusion-reactor.com\" target=\"_blank\">Fusion Reactor</a>\'s AIR Dashboard (what a godsend product).\r\n\r\n<h2>The Next Phase</h2>\r\n\r\nNow that we sit on a standardized platform, with servers that perform well and less time monitoring server health, it\'s time to think about application architecture. To support a more agile development model, changes must be made to core application architecture, to streamline, simplify, and get with best practice standards. The first phase of this will be to document our current architecture, one piece at a time, to truly understand all aspects of the related business logic and end run goals of each and every piece of our applications. This will make it easier to identify areas of over-complexity, catalog what works well and what doesn\'t, and begin to develop better, and scalable, methods of achieving the same goals, with an eye on the ability to expand through modularization and reusability of code.\r\n\r\nThe lesson we learned was that there is a very fine line, at times, between being a small business and being an enterprise class business. Defining a timeline on when to refactor isn\'t really as important as doing it right the first time, but sometimes you don\'t have that luxury. Make the time to reassess your application\'s performance on a regular basis, tune your JVM to fit your application (read <a href=\"http://alagad.com/go/blog?createdBy=mbrunt\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Brunt</a>), and rewrite anything that needs to be written better whenever you get a few minutes.','Build-Applications-That-Scale','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',4978,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

ExtJS 1.1 is the underlying library used by <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 8</a> in it\'s new Ajax controls, so I latched on to the concept of rapid application prototyping and then extending it through custom ExtJS development.\r\n\r\nWell, Monday the ExtJS team released 2.2. Much more than a minor dot release, 2.2 addresses several bug fixes, nice increases in perfomance, better support for <a href=\"http://www.getfirefox.com\" target=\"_blank\">Firefox 3</a>, and several new components and examples.\r\n\r\nSome of the new components include CheckBoxGroups and RadioGroups for forms, a new History object for managing the back button (a common issue in RIAs), a new FileUploadField, and even an XMLTreeLoader to automatically create Tree components from an XML Document. There are several new examples, to show developers how to use these new components, better information on how to implement Drag and Drop, and more.\r\n\r\nExtJS 2.2 is fully backwards compatible with the 2.1 release. I tested several applications last night, seeing definite speed increases. Really well done. (There also appears to be some speed improvements when implementing ExtJS within <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/air/\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe AIR</a> applications as well, from my testing.)\r\n\r\nI\'ll have a lot more info on ExtJS coming in the near future, so watch this space;)','2008-08-07 09:07:00',NULL,'ExtJS-22-Released','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',3907,1,1,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),

I have a rather large side project I\'ve been working on, written entirely with an <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJS</a> front-end and ColdFusion on the back-end. I\'m hoping to get that into a QA phase in the next week or two. I also just celebrated my 39<sup>th</sup> birthday, my 8<sup>th</sup> wedding anniversary, my daughter is the rock star of the 1<sup>st</sup> grade (pulling straight A pluses in every category), and the holiday\'s are coming.\r\n\r\nOn top of everything else, I\'m putting the final touches on <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book\" target=\"_blank\">Learning Ext JS</a>, to go to press at the end of the week/beginning of next, and due out in December. I\'ve stayed relatively quiet on this, as I wanted to wait until <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com\" target=\"_blank\">PackT</a>, my publisher, officially released information on the book. Let me start by saying that a few years ago I never would have thought I\'d be doing this much client-side development again. And I definitely wouldn\'t have imagined me contributing to a book about client-side development.\r\n\r\nI began looking at ExtJS quite a while back, while contemplating how to \"jazz up\" and modernize some dated interfaces I was supporting. I thought that ExtJS was an exceptionally well thought out library of rich, consistant components and functionality. While I use <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a> almost exclusively for DOM queries and manipulation, I really didn\'t find enough consistency in the visual plugins at the time (this has improved with the latest round of the <a href=\"http://ui.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery UI</a> plugins). I began to learn of the real power of ExtJS, and became an even bigger fan when it was announced that <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> was including it in Scorpio, the codename for ColdFusion 8, Adobe\'s first implementation of the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> web application platform since it\'s acquisition with the Macromedia merger. Sweet! A total win-win for me.\r\n\r\nBack in June, PackT contacted me. It seems they had started to develop a book, but the primary author, <a href=\"http://www.vinylfox.com\" target=\"_blank\">Shea Frederick</a>, had gotten bogged down in other commitments before being able to complete the project. Some Googling on their part led them to Colin Ramsay and myself, through Cutter\'s Crossing. So they contacted me to find out if I was interested. The timing on this was awful. I was just starting the previously mentioned side project, my daughter was on her very first summer vacation, and just a lot of things going on. But it was too good to pass up. Aside from the fame and glory (yeah, right!), I knew that there weren\'t any other books out there on ExtJS, and it would be an excellent book to get out there for all the people trying to learn this exciting library. After talking the pros and cons with <a href=\"http://www.trajiklyhip.com\" target=\"_blank\">Aaron West</a>, and getting sign off from my family, I finally contacted the Jedi himself, <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Camden</a>, to get some info on the writing process. We talked about time (a lot), commitment (more), and fame (maybe a little) and fortune (nearly none). I finally went ahead and said I would do it.\r\n\r\nSo, here it is almost six months later. I took on the final three chapters of the book: working with data stores (think like browser cached data table sets), extending Ext objects to build your own custom components, and the book wrap-up, which covers all the little stuff many people miss because they aren\'t typically visible. Only one chapter has any server-side code (the data stores). PackT originally wanted to convert my ColdFusion examples to PHP, to conform with the rest of the book. This morning the publisher told me that they want to keep my ColdFusion examples, to show that the ExtJS library can work with any server-side technology.\r\n\r\nSo, <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book\" target=\"_blank\">they\'re taking pre-order now,</a> just in time for the holidays.

 ('AA29647A-3048-71C2-172ACB904E688E31','Hurdles For ColdFusion Hosting Providers','One thing that we, the <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> community, have been hearing since the release of ColdFusion 8 is that hosting costs should come down. <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has been working hard to strike deals with hosting providers to provide hosting solutions that are as competitive as hosting for other server-side languages, such as .NET or PHP. They\'ve been doing this by doing things like changing their <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/eula/third_party/coldfusion/8/\" target=\"_blank\">EULA agreement</a> to support multi-procs, disaster recovery backups, and VM hosting, as well as through special licensing deals. Unfortunately, outside forces are working against them in this.\r\n\r\n>Hosting services contain a lot of other costs, that are generally hidden to the end user. One such cost is in server administration. Any developer, setting up their own development environment, will realize that the real manual labor is spent in IIS or Apache administration, DNS management, SQL configuration and the like. Most hosting companies utilize third party software to help automate a lot of these tasks, cutting maintenance time significantly. There haven\'t been many software control panels that support ColdFusion. Chief among these, for some time, has been <a href=\"http://www.parallels.com/plesk/\" target=\"_blank\">Parallels Plesk Control Panel</a>. This software is brought to you by the same folks who bring the popular VM used on Macs to virtualize Windows. It\'s an extremely nice piece of software, allowing a very nice interface that integrates with several key technologies used by most any hosting provider.\r\n\r\nSo you might be asking \"What\'s the problem?\" Well, the suits at Parallels have moved to a Software As A Service model, and the pricing structure has changed significantly. There were other options out there, like Ensim Pro, Helm, and H-Sphere, but Parallels bought them all up, effectively taking over the market for hosting Control Panels that support ColdFusion. Nice monopoly they have now, at least within our space.\r\n\r\nOutside of the community banding together to write their own software, their aren\'t any other options currently available for a ColdFusion hosting Control Panel. There is a very nice package for Windows based systems called <a href=\"http://www.dotnetpanel.com\" target=\"_blank\">dotnetpanel</a>, but they do not currently support ColdFusion. They are considering support, pending justification to build it. My friend <a href=\"http://emmetmcgovern.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Emmet McGovern</a>, of <a href=\"http://fullcitymedia.com/index.cfm\" target=\"_blank\">Full City Media</a> (the kind folks who host this blog, and who always have my thanks), is on a mission to give dotnetpanel that justification. He started a <a href=\"http://forum.dotnetpanel.com/forums/t/4918.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Forum Thread</a>, on the dotnetpanel forum, to gather feedback from the CF community for dotnetpanel to add ColdFusion support to their Control Panel product. To anyone out there that acts as a hosting provider, and even to you CFers who\'ve been waiting on lower cost ColdFusion hosting, I urge you to stop by their site and put in your vote.','2008-11-17 06:13:00',NULL,'Hurdles-For-ColdFusion-Hosting-Providers','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2806,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('BC176621-3048-71C2-174F35E80FBDFBB0','ColdFusion Query Json Custom Data Reader For ExtJS','<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a>\'s implementation of JSON return for <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> is great, and frustrating. They use a non-standard return in that, instead of the expected name/value pairs, they return first a COLUMNS element, listing the column names only once, and then the DATA array of the record set values. The column names are listed in the order with which the data is listed in each array element. This is great, in the fact that the data packets are much smaller than the traditional return (traditional meaning, that which is returned by most other app servers), but the down side is, it isn\'t traditional.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://ideamill.synaptrixgroup.com\" target=\"_blank\">John Wilson</a> wrote a custom Data Reader for the <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ext JS</a> library, to help with parsing the ColdFusion return. However, although it created records within a Data Store, it didn\'t handle the column aliasing you are usually capable of when defining fields, nor did it properly cast variables as it should. I finally had a chance to run it through Firebug, and step through the process, at which point I also really had a chance to review the custom extension.\r\n\r\nWhile it worked, it really wasn\'t using the best tool for the job. The extension extended the Ext.data.DataReader base component. The ColdFusion return basically gives you an Array of records (the DATA), and Ext JS already provides an Ext.data.ArrayReader object that extends the JsonReader. So, after some refactoring and general tinkering, I now release the CFQueryReader custom Ext data reader.\r\n\r\nInspired by the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/forum/showthread.php?t=21408&highlight=cfjsonreader\" target=\"_blank\">CFJsonReader</a>, originally writtin by John Wilson (Daemach).\r\n\r\nThis Custom Data Reader will take the JSON return of a ColdFusion Query object, rather returned straight up, or via the ColdFusion QueryForGrid() method.\r\n\r\nThe CFQueryReader constructor takes two arguments\r\n@meta : object containing single key/value pair for the \'id\' of each record, equating to the \'mapping\' of the column\r\n@recordType : field mapping object\r\n\r\nThe recordType object allows you to alias the returned ColdFusion column  name (which is always passed in upper case) to any \'name\' you wish, as well as assign a data type, which your ExtJS app will attempt to cast whenever the value is referenced.\r\n\r\nColdFusion\'s JSON return, for a ColdFusion Query object, will appear in the following format:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n{\"COLUMNS\":[\"INTVENDORTYPEID\",\"STRVENDORTYPE\",\"INTEXPENSECATEGORIESID\",\r\n\"STREXPENSECATEGORIES\"],\"DATA\" :[[2,\"Carpet Cleaning\",1,\"Cleaining\"],\r\n[1,\"Cleaning Service\",1,\"Cleaining\"]]}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe ColdFusion JSON return on any query that is first passed through ColdFusion\'s QueryForGrid() method will return the object in the following format:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n{\"TOTALROWCOUNT\":3, \"QUERY\":{\"COLUMNS\":[\"MYIDFIELD\",\"DATA1\",\"DATA2\"],\r\n\"DATA\":[[1,\"Bob\",\"Smith\"],[6,\"Jim\",\"Brown\"]]}}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe Ext.data.CFQueryReader is designed to accomodate either format automatically. You would create your reader instance in much the same way as the CFJsonReader was created:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nvar myDataModel = [\r\n	{name: \'myIdField\', mapping: \'MYIDFIELD\'},\r\n	{name: \'data1\', mapping: \'DATA1\'},\r\n	{name: \'data2\', mapping: \'DATA2\'}\r\n];\r\n\r\nvar myCFReader =  new Ext.data.CFQueryReader({id:\'MYIDFIELD\'},myDataModel);\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nNotice that the \'id\' value mirrors the alias \'name\' of the record\'s field.\r\n\r\nThe CFQueryReader is available from the below download link.

 ('4C05754F-3048-71C2-173BD16F550D16B9','Where Do You Stand?','Several months ago gas in Nashville cost almost $3 a gallon. One enterprising station owner decided to charge around $2.60 a gallon, while all of his competition was at the $2.97 range. While he did this, people were lined up to get in the station. People were pouring through his little convenience mart, to go to the bathroom, or maybe pick up on his 2 for $2 Coca Cola deals. His competitor\'s stations (there are 4 more within a two block radius) were nearly empty.\r\n\r\nThis station owner was a very smart man. Did he lose money? His profit margin may have been smaller, but the traffic and sales increase probably doubled his typical profit intake. He had to bring in tankers three times a day to refill his tanks, and some delivery truck was almost always there restocking something in his convenience store.\r\n\r\nThere is a lesson to be learned here by America\'s retailers. If you\'ve never worked in retail management, you don\'t know what kind of mark-ups most retailers have on the goods you and I purchase every day. Sometimes those mark-ups are anywhere from 70 - 100% of the actual cost of goods. Bars and Restaurants even more so, where the mark-up could be as much as 600% on some items. Now, to be fair, these businesses have a lot of overhead they have to pay: salaries, utilities, licenses, security, insurance, etc. But, notice they\'re having trouble doing some of these things right now? No one is buying.\r\n\r\nThis is called \"market correction\". See, we (the American public) have allowed these companies to more or less rape us for years. Why is it that an automobile that cost $3,000 is 1977 will cost $18,000 today? Why does a gallon of milk cost almost $3.50? Why is it that a gallon of gas that sold for $1.15 in 1999...? Well, because we let them charge us that much. And right now, we\'re done. Not only won\'t we pay those rates, we can\'t.\r\n\r\nThe government is so heavily involved in trying to \'bailout\' America  (Have you <a href=\"http://readthestimulus.org/\" target=\"_blank\">read the stimulus plan</a>?), that big business is still losing the Big Picture. You want your people to stay employed? You want to get back towards the black? You want to keep getting fat bonuses, and have the funding to continue driving innovation and expansion? OK, then charge a reasonable rate for product. What is really more important, a fat profit margin, or staying in business?\r\n\r\nI know, there are dozens of other factors involved here. Employers think they pay too much for help. Employees don\'t think they get paid enough. Unions want every benefit the rest of the American public can\'t afford. Fuel and utility costs are rising, increasing the expenditures and affecting the bottom line. When does the cycle stop? When do we, the American public, wake up and say enough is enough? When do American businesses say \"We can do better by the American people, and survive, and be profitable.\" and start working with the boundaries of sanity. $250 for a Wii and $40 a game? It\'s a f@%#ing game. $200 for an iPhone? It\'s a damn phone. $80 for a pair of Nike? They\'re shoes for God\'s sake, they\'re gonna wear out in six months if you use \'em right.\r\n\r\nWhen did we become so screwed up that we would continually let ourselves be taken advantage of? When does common sense sink in and we all say \"No\"? (When does \"Common Sense\" become common again?) There is a difference between being profitable, and being Greedy.\r\n\r\nIt takes people, average Americans like you and I, to stand up and be heard. It takes forcing retailers and businesses to \"get it straight.\" What do you want to say? What do you want to do? How do you want to live? These aren\'t just retorical questions, I\'m looking for your feedback. Stand up and be heard.','2009-02-06 09:33:00',NULL,'Where-Do-You-Stand','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2289,1,1,'','','',''),

I got into a conversation with <a href=\"http://www.clarkvalberg.com\" target=\"_blank\">Clark Valberg</a> about linguistics. I was a translator in latter half of my time in the military, and Clark was asking if I thought my experience with learning another language had helped me in learning to be a better developer?\r\n\r\nI absolutely agreed. I have an aptitude for languages, and always have. It\'s something I\'ve picked up, and I can generally get to a point where I can effectively communicate (at least on the simplest of terms) within a very short time. Programming isn\'t much different, if you think about it. When I first got into computing again, after leaving the Army, I was teaching myself ten different programming languages at the same time. I had a lot of catching up to do, being out of the game for so long, so I picked up some books, found online resources, and took to the task of getting up to speed.\r\n\r\nMaybe that\'s why there are so many talented developers outside the US. In the US, we aren\'t required to learn another language out of necessity, whereas in most other countries of the world (not all, but most) it is very commonplace for people to speak two or more languages.\r\n\r\nYou can kind of apply this in the reverse, to some degree, as well. Those who only learn one development platform may be limiting themselves. Knowing one programming language inside and out can be a good thing, but learning others can also open a developer to new ways of approaching a challenge. I\'ve known many developers who knew a server-side language (ColdFusion, ASP, PHP, whatever), but never bothered to learn JavaScript, or how to write well formed XHTML. To me, that\'s limiting. Even crippling.\r\n\r\nWhat are your thoughts?','2009-02-19 08:53:00',NULL,'Development-Ties','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1994,1,1,'','','',''),

Last night I had dinner and drinks with Jeff, a really nice guy who heads up development for a group writing web based interfaces to hardware appliances. Turns out Jeff is also the guy who introduced <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript\" target=\"_blank\">JavaScript</a> to <a href=\"http://www.crockford.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Douglas Crockford</a>, who was today\'s keynote speaker. Douglas made sure to recognize Jeff at the beginning of his keynote, which I thought was a nice nod to the guy who helped give him direction in his career. Douglas ran us through a brief history of hypertext, the evolution of the web, JavaScipt, and the browser wars, before touching on the future of the web, some of the things in the new JavaScript specs being worked on through <a href=\"http://www.ecma-international.org/\" target=\"_blank\">ECMA</a>, and the fact that none of it would matter for years until the browser manufacturers would implement it. He did give props to Flash, AIR and SilverLight for trying to further the web experience where it has lagged so much over the years. He also spoke about the pitfalls of security in Web 2.0 applications, and the primary culprits of those issues (the browser manufacturers).\r\n\r\nBefore I go a whole lot further, let me tell you that the conference center, and their service to us, is fantastic. Held at the <a href=\"http://www.ritzcarlton.com/en/Properties/Orlando/Default.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Ritz-Carlton Orlando</a>, the location is beautiful with it\'s palm lined drives, a well groomed golf course winding around several \'water traps\', and a huge pool with several fountains. The food has been exceptional, with an incredible meal at lunch, complete with salad, brazed chicken, and desert with complete table service (this as part of the conference). No buffet sandwhiches here, though a breakfast buffet would have been nice before that 830 session this morning. My room is about half the size of the one I had at the <a href=\"http://www.rougehotel.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Hotel Rouge</a> last year for WebManiacs, but it is very comfortable and service keeps it nice. The shower did flood the entire bathroom this morning and the in-room coffee is horribly weak (and small), but everything can\'t be perfect. I\'ve also carried on my conference tradition of bringing a sinus infection with me, which is keeping me from the after-session activities this evening, but the concierge was able to get me covered with some NyQuil for the evening to try to knock this stuff out of me.\r\n\r\nAaron Conran, fellow <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> developer and one of the original contributors to <a href=\"http://www.coldboxframework.com/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdBox</a>, delivered the session covering what has changed and what\'s new within the 3.0 release, which is officially released tomorrow by Jack Slocum during his keynote. A great deal of work has been spent to make the upgrade fairly painless, with attention payed to backwards compatability, improvements to overall memory management (always important), and an eye towards keeping the code lean and mean, doing what is necessary to keep code size to a minimum and eliminate any unnecessary bloat. Menus and Toolbars have been converted into true Container objects, and the only significant markup changes appear to be to the Button objects.\r\n\r\nThere are several new visual components, maintaining the professional feel and consistency that has made Ext JS so compelling. Two that attracted a great deal of attention were the ListView and the Buffered Grid View. Sometimes you want the basic view afforded by a Grid, without having the need for (or the overhead of) things like drag and drop column ordering, sorting, and the like. The ListView gives you a basic grid style layout without all of that overhead, and a very trim DOM footprint as well, providing your view without unnecessary code bloat and browser memory overhead. The Buffered Grid View is a full Grid implementation that allows the browser to only render DOM for records in actual view, plus a few extra to make smooth transitions on scrolling, that automatically adds and removes DOM items when scrolling through your recordsets. The memory management improvements with this, and other changes, are very nice to see. Like the new .mon(), or \'managed on\', methods that allow you to bind events in a temporary fashion, getting a proper cleanup from browser memory when that component gets destroyed. This was actually a method of Ext prior to it\'s 1.0 release, and has been heavily requested for this return.\r\n\r\nBeing the server-side guy that I\'ve been for the last decade, the important new components came to the Ext.data package, with the addition of the Ext.data.Direct and Ext.data.DataWriter classes. Direct provides the ability to marshall your remote service call definitions into one container, calling your Ajax data requests from a centralized location with the ability to make multiple commands through a single Ajax request as well as call listeners on specific actions performed by Direct. Chris Scott did a presentation on Direct this afternoon, explaining how the developer has to create a server side Router to which Direct can attach it\'s requests, and showing us all a nice and very simple example (even if it was written in Ruby). The Ext Team provides a Reference for development of Routers in a number of server-side languages, including ColdFusion, PHP, Ruby, and .NET. The DataWriter class, covered in more depth in a future session, does for POST requests what the DataReader does for your GET requests, allowing a developer to define your routing of requests to send data back to the server. The combination of these classes with the existing classes of the Ext.data package really improves upon the power of using Ext with any server-side technology.\r\n\r\nI was able to see the presentation on the Direct class because of a snafu with a scheduling change of the presentation of the Ext.air package. Originally these two sessions were the one conflict in my schedule, but they moved the Ext.air presentation session up a time slot (a change I didn\'t know of until after the fact) which allowed me the opportunity to sit in on Chris\'s session. Luckily the presentations are being recorded and are supposed to be available online after the conference. I\'m glad they\'re doing this, since I had to leave during my final session of the day, on Ext.Core, due to the sinus issues that progressively worsened through the day. The Ext.air session is one I am very looking forward to watching.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Ext Team are a great group of guys. Abe, again, congratulated me on the book, and invited me to sit in on the Industry Experts panel tomorrow. I\'ve had several people say they wished they had brought their copies of the <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book\" target=\"_blank\">book</a> so Shea and I could have signed them for them. One attendee asked why <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com\" target=\"_blank\">PackT</a> didn\'t have a booth setup somewhere, which is when I first noticed that their don\'t appear to be any outside sponsors for the conference. Ext appears to have financed the conference solely through the registration of the 200+ attending, which is pretty impressive considering the facility and it\'s services. On another note, ColdFusion has been publicly mentioned in several presentations, and with so many different server-side programmers represented here it is refreshing to hear so many comment that they should give ColdFusion a hard look.\r\n\r\nAnd with that, I\'m going to pack it in for the evening and pray that the NyQuil does it\'s job to kick the junk out of my head. Tomorrow looks to be an exciting day, with Jack\'s keynote releasing Ext 3.0, sessions on User Experience Design, Theming, and Performance Optimization. I\'ll be posting updates to <a href=\"http://www.twitter.com/cutterbl\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and my Facebook profile throughout the day.

The intent is to make for a more portable application, where you can have a single touch point for data I/O that could easily be switched from one platform to another.\r\n\r\nThis is done through the new Ext.Direct package of classes, and many have been waiting on some detailed information on what it is and how to use it.

He had been looking at my <a href=\"http://cfqueryreader.cutterscrossing.com\" target=\"_blank\">CFQueryReader</a>, as a reader for ColdFusion\'s JSON data return, and had noticed that there was no support for the \'root\' attribute that\'s associated with most JSON readers in Ext. CFQueryReader is specifically designed for use with Query objects of ColdFusion 8\'s native JSON return type.\r\n\r\nWhen I first wrote CFQueryReader, I was replacing the CFJsonReader with something better suited to the array structure used in the ColdFusion JSON return of a Query Object, and really did a one-for-one port. So, I took a deeper look at the issue Justin wanted resolved.\r\n\r\nI did a deep comparison of Ext\'s ArrayReader and JsonReader source code, following everything that was being accomplished. What I found was how it used an internal accessor method to pull certain information on demand. I was able to refactor the reader to now support all of the base level meta attributes that are currently available to the ArrayReader: id, root, successProperty, and totalProperty.\r\n\r\nIn the previous version of CFQueryReader, when defining your fieldsets you were also required to uppercase the entire value of the column names. This is no longer a requirement either, although casing is important in identifying your \'root\' and \'totalProperty\' attributes.\r\n\r\nThe download below includes the reader, as well as some sample code showing how to implement it.

 ('68C2DC1B-3048-71C2-17FBECCF71CD17BE','Placement of the PagingToolbar on a Grid','This morning I found I was courtesy copied by <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Camden</a>, on a reply that he was making to a message he had received from his Blog Contact form from Mike Knox. Mike was trying to find out if it was possible to place the PagingToolbar, used in cfgrid, at the top of the grid rather than the bottom. Ray had told Mike that he had Googled it and not found on obvious solution, and that he was CCing me for my feedback.\r\n\r\nLike any padawan, it\'s pretty humbling for me to be asked advice from the Jedi Master. I\'ve been taking Ray\'s advice on <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> since the 4.x days, so I try to be pretty diligent when he includes me in helping others with their queries.\r\n\r\nI\'ve always held that the use of the CF Ajax components are primarily for rapid application prototyping. They are fantastic for putting up some very basic functionality, but when you need more advanced configuration it is then time to dig in, and go straight to <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ext JS</a> itself. Mike\'s question is a prime example of this. We have nearly no control over a cfgrid\'s configuration prior to render, and the configuration options that we do have (through the cfgrid and cfgridcolumn attributes) barely scratch the surface to what one can do with an Ext Grid. The PagingToolbar is a class object of Ext and, as such, you should be able to add it to any toolbar of a grid: top, bottom, or both. I fired up Eclipse, booted up my CF and Apache, and pulled up the Ext examples from my local copy of the latest 3.0 download. All of the examples that you can see in the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/samples.html\" target=\"_blank\">Samples & Demos</a> section of the Ext site are given to you in the download of the library, so that you can run them locally and pick them apart. So, my quest was on.\r\n\r\nI went to the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/grid/paging.html\" target=\"_blank\">Paging Grid Example</a>, and examined the source code of the <a href=\"http://extjs.com/deploy/dev/examples/grid/paging.js\" target=\"_blank\">paging.js</a> file. I quickly found the configuration object for the paging toolbar:\r\n    \r\n    <code>\r\n    var pagingBar = new Ext.PagingToolbar({\r\n        pageSize: 25,\r\n        store: store,\r\n        displayInfo: true,\r\n        displayMsg: \'Displaying topics {0} - {1} of {2}\',\r\n        emptyMsg: \"No topics to display\",\r\n        \r\n        items:[\r\n            \'-\', {\r\n            pressed: true,\r\n            enableToggle:true,\r\n            text: \'Show Preview\',\r\n            cls: \'x-btn-text-icon details\',\r\n            toggleHandler: function(btn, pressed){\r\n                var view = grid.getView();\r\n                view.showPreview = pressed;\r\n                view.refresh();\r\n            }\r\n        }]\r\n    });\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\n The PagingToolbar instance is then applied to the Grid, placing the object in the \'bbar\' (bottom bar) attribute:\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n        // paging bar on the bottom\r\n        bbar: pagingBar\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nAfter seeing this in the online demo, I went to my local (3.0) demo to see if I could change it. The Ext team rewrote the demo for the upcoming 3.0 release, placing the instance initialization directly in the attribute:\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n        // paging bar on the bottom\r\n        bbar: new Ext.PagingToolbar({\r\n            pageSize: 25,\r\n            store: store,\r\n            displayInfo: true,\r\n            displayMsg: \'Displaying topics {0} - {1} of {2}\',\r\n            emptyMsg: \"No topics to display\",\r\n            items:[\r\n                \'-\', {\r\n                pressed: true,\r\n                enableToggle:true,\r\n                text: \'Show Preview\',\r\n                cls: \'x-btn-text-icon details\',\r\n                toggleHandler: function(btn, pressed){\r\n                    var view = grid.getView();\r\n                    view.showPreview = pressed;\r\n                    view.refresh();\r\n                }\r\n            }]\r\n        })\r\n        </code>\r\n\r\nSo, I changed \'bbar\' to \'tbar\' (top bar) and reloaded the page. Success! The PagingToolbar was now in the top toolbar of the Grid, and fully functional. After reviewing all of this, I decided to go a step further. Could you have two separate PagingToolbar configs on the grid? One at the top and one at the bottom? So, I tried this:\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n        // paging bar on the bottom\r\n        bbar: new Ext.PagingToolbar({\r\n            pageSize: 25,\r\n            store: store,\r\n            displayInfo: true,\r\n            displayMsg: \'Displaying topics {0} - {1} of {2}\',\r\n            emptyMsg: \"No topics to display\",\r\n            items:[\r\n                \'-\', {\r\n                pressed: true,\r\n                enableToggle:true,\r\n                text: \'Show Preview\',\r\n                cls: \'x-btn-text-icon details\',\r\n                toggleHandler: function(btn, pressed){\r\n                    var view = grid.getView();\r\n                    view.showPreview = pressed;\r\n                    view.refresh();\r\n                }\r\n            }]\r\n        }),\r\n        // paging bar on the top\r\n        tbar: new Ext.PagingToolbar({\r\n            pageSize: 25,\r\n            store: store,\r\n            displayInfo: true,\r\n            displayMsg: \'Displaying topics {0} - {1} of {2}\',\r\n            emptyMsg: \"No topics to display\",\r\n            items:[\r\n                \'-\', {\r\n                pressed: true,\r\n                enableToggle:true,\r\n                text: \'Show Preview\',\r\n                cls: \'x-btn-text-icon details\',\r\n                toggleHandler: function(btn, pressed){\r\n                    var view = grid.getView();\r\n                    view.showPreview = pressed;\r\n                    view.refresh();\r\n                }\r\n            }]\r\n        })\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nThat\'s part of what I love about development, I get to play, experiment, have some (geek) fun. After refreshing the page, I now had two toolbars, at both the top and bottom of the page. Both worked perfectly, and stayed in sync during paging. That\'s what I love about the Jack Slocum and the Ext Team, they think about things like having more than one paging bar and how they would need to stay in sync, and they\'ve already written it in to the library.\r\n\r\nAnd so, on rare occasion, the student has the opportunity to become the master, though I\'m sure there\'s still plenty more I can learn from Master Camden;)','2009-05-22 10:33:00',NULL,'Placement-of-the-PagingToolbar-on-a-Grid','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',4070,1,1,'','','',''),

Another \'scope\' issue that I\'ve often seen (and abused myself) is the misuse of the VARIABLES scope. Back in the early days of CF, every example you saw showed an unscoped variable, placing it into the VARIABLES scope by default. This was fine, back then, as your view layers primarily consisted of Custom Tags. Use of the VARIABLES scope, within a custom tag, was permissable as those variables were then only available within that tag (or within a nested tag, if the nested tag used the CALLER scope). Once execution of the tag was completed, the memory space of those variables was cleared.\r\n\r\nBut, since custom tags were made from .cfm templates, there is no constraint within CFML from placing VARIABLES scoped variables within <strong>any</strong> .cfm template. This, in itself, is bad, as the VARIABLES scope (in the case of a base template, not a custom tag) is not properly cleared from memory space.\r\n\r\nWhat I find people doing (and I\'ve done it myself) is using the VARIABLES scope in place of the REQUEST scope. Memory allocated to REQUEST variables is properly recovered at the end of a request. Although variables in the VARIABLES scope are no longer available (except within a persistent CFC), their memory isn\'t properly released at the end of request execution. (For more information on this, see Jason Sheedy\'s post on the <a href=\"http://www.jmpj.net/jason/index.cfm/2007/4/14/Cold-Fusion-Memory-Leak\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion Memory Leak</a>, and the accompanying comment thread and other referenced posts.)\r\n\r\nA technique that some used, to get around this issue, was to have a <em>StructClear(VARIABLES)</em> statement as the last line of their onRequestEnd.cfm. This would explicitly clear out the VARIABLES scope at the end of a request. But, with the advent of Application.cfc, this no longer became an option (if you use Application.cfc.) If you tried to use that statement within the <em>onRequestEnd()</em> method of Application.cfc, you would only be clearing the VARIABLES scope of the CFC itself, and not the request.\r\n\r\nThat\'s actually a good pointer at the true underlying issue: proper scope usage. Use of the VARIABLES scope within a CFC makes variables within that scope <em>only</em> available directly by all methods of that CFC. Use of the VARIABLES scope within a custom tag makes variables within that scope <em>only</em> available within that tag (or a nested tag using the CALLER scope to access them.) Within a custom tag, you can not access variables of the calling template\'s VARIABLES scope, unless you use the CALLER scope to do so (which should only be in the case of a nested custom tag). You can, however, access REQUEST variables through out the request, from within a custom tag, an include file, or even within a CFC (though I wouldn\'t suggest doing that one.) By confining the usage of the VARIABLES scope to within custom tags and CFC\'s, and properly setting request level variables within the REQUEST scope, you could better manage your memory usage and application performance.\r\n\r\nI\'ve personally seen major differences in application performance, both through Mike\'s advice on persistent scope usage, as well as what I\'ve outlined above. Unlike Jason Sheedy though, I\'m not very familiar with Java profiling tools, so I\'ll have to leave it up to someone else to test all of this for the scientific proof. I only know that it appears my applications are running better as I migrate them to this paradigm. What are your thoughts?\r\n\r\n*** Post Revision 080609: 2230 hrs ***\r\nMore revision to my comments than the post itself, but Ray, the ColdFusion Jedi himself, corrected me. According to Ray, the VARIABLES scope wasn\'t added until CFMX, so my supposition on the \'intention\' of the VARIABLES scope was incorrect. You really have to read the comment thread to see the fun we\'re having;) Hopefully we\'ll find an answer. <em>Cutter</em>','2009-08-06 15:29:00',NULL,'Scope-Usage-and-Application-Scaling','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',3906,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('062482FA-3048-71C2-178D4B764DD3B529','Request vs Variables - Which is right?','Last week I stirred the pot a bit, stating that we\'ve been improperly using the VARIABLES scope, and it\'s hurting our applications. Variables placed within the VARIABLES scope do not appear to have proper Garbage Collection performed on them when we\'re done with them, except in the case of the scope\'s usage within a CFC or a custom tag. This brought up some interesting discussion, where Ray Camden, Mike Brunt, and others chimed in.\r\n\r\nI, with very good success, have been using REQUEST where most people use the VARIABLES scope. Wait! Hold on! You have to let me finish first before you get bent. What I said was that, in the past, we placed variables into the VARIABLES scope within our base request templates, with no way of clearing those variables at the end of the request (if using Application.cfc). My thought is, if VARIABLES have no true (apparent) mechanism for release, in context of variables scoped this way in a base request, then they don\'t really belong in the VARIABLES scope, but rather in the REQUEST scope.\r\n\r\nThis was met with some push back. The first argument was that this breaks encapsulation. I want to begin my response here by saying the first obvious thing that comes to mind: ColdFusion is not OO! Sure, your ColdFusion application can be written in an OO fashion, but ultimately it doesn\'t have to be. There are even some who seem that think that maybe it shouldn\'t be. All of that being said, I agree with OO principles, and think that proper encapsulation is very important when developing your applications, especially in terms of portability and reuse. Just because the REQUEST scope <em>can</em> be used directly within your custom tags or CFC\'s <strong>doesn\'t</strong> mean that you should. I would never suggest referencing the REQUEST scope directly within a CFC, with the exception of Application.cfc itself.\r\n\r\nSo another argument was that the REQUEST scope should only be used \"when (and only when) the variable must be accessible to all the elements composing the request...\", going further to state that the REQUEST scope should be avoided if at all possible. Why? The rest of the argument once again comes back to encapsulation. My point is to use the REQUEST scope within the context of a <em>request</em>, paying attention to maintain encapsulation. Within that context, doesn\'t it make <em>sense</em> to use the REQUEST scope for variables that should only exist for the length of a request?\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion Jedi</a> piped in to correct me on my timeline of scope introductions to ColdFusion, and we had some back and forth over declaration of scope to clearing of scope. I contended that onApplicationEnd() cleared the APPLICATION scope, that onSessiondEnd() cleared the SESSION scope, and that onRequestEnd() cleared the REQUEST scope. Ray reminded me that Application.cfc was about application process, and that the server handled when to \'clear\' variables \'under the hood.\' My point back was that <em>something</em> has to tell the server when to de-reference these variables, and that I had always assumed that was triggered by the execution of these methods. <a href=\"http://www.cfwhisperer.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Mike Brunt</a> chimed in on this, saying that the application must de-reference the variables prior to the server knowing it can perform Garbage Collection on them (Side Note: he didn\'t come out and agree with all of my conclusions here, only seeming to agree with the logic applied.)\r\n\r\nPossibly the largest argument overall relates to whether the apparent memory leak, when using the VARIABLES scope within a base request, is really a leak or just a byproduct? I\'ve theorized that the intention of the VARIABLES scope was that it was to be used <em>only</em> within CFC\'s and custom tags, where it does appear to properly get de-referenced. I put out there that the only reason you were able to use VARIABLES within the base request was because custom tags were created from .cfm files as well, so there really isn\'t any way to restrict it\'s usage. Ray says that the VARIABLES scope was introduced to provide access (like StructKeyExists()) to the unscoped variables out there in the wild.I think our thoughts of \'best practice\' usage should follow these lines: Using the REQUEST scope within the base request, while maintaining encapsulation.\r\n\r\nUltimately, I just don\'t know. Maybe there\'s still an Adobe engineer out there who goes back that far, and can remember exactly what\'s what and why. I do know that, after migrating several high traffic applications to these guidelines I did get a higher return on application performance. I\'ve gotten notes from others, after reading the original post, who have done similar changes to their systems with the same improvements. What other pluses or minuses do you, dear reader, think of when considering this practice of variable scoping? Is it right? Is it wrong? Is it a sin? What do you say?\r\n\r\n(You can follow the original comment thread by referencing the post linked below)','2009-08-10 17:06:00',NULL,'Request-vs-Variables--Which-is-right','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',3467,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('30877980-3048-71C2-17DEFABDC4A4CEFD','ColdFusion for the Redmond Crowd','Some time back I started receiving <a href=\"http://www.visualstudiomagazine.com\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Magazine</a>. I\'m not sure why. I didn\'t request it, and lord knows I\'ve tried to stay away long enough (since the VB6 days). But, being a developer with a background in linguistics, I began to read through the issues. C# looks interesting, and I\'ll probably play with it some, but for the most part all of it just reminds me why I\'m a ColdFusion developer with skills in related web type languages (XHTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc).\r\n\r\nLast week I received my August issue of VSM, and took a look when I got a chance. I got a number of surprises with this issue, the first one being the biggest. In the front of magazine is an \'Online Contents\' section, where they list articles that are only available on the web from three Redmond Developer Network sites: <a href=\"http://www.visualstudiomagazine.com\" target=\"_blank\">Visual Studio Magazine</a>, <a href=\"http://www.reddevnews.com\" target=\"_blank\">Redmond Developer News</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.adtmag.com\" target=\"_blank\">Application Development Trends</a>. And, to my surprise, under the articles on ADT, the first heading read <a href=\"http://adtmag.com/articles/2009/07/15/adobe-releases-first-beta-of-coldfusion-9.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe Releases First Beta of ColdFusion 9</a>.\r\n\r\nNow, here\'s a magazine dedicated to .NET development, pointing to sites dedicated to .NET development, highlighting an article about ColdFusion. Nice! This was obviously part of the interview blitz that <a href=\"http://www.adrocknaphobia.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Lehman</a> did just before the public release. The article talks about <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusionbuilder/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion Builder</a>, quotes the recent <a href=\"http://www.gartner.com/DisplayDocument?doc_cd=165146\" target=\"_blank\">Gartner Report</a>, and talks about the great new features in <a href=\"http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/coldfusion9/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 9</a>, with emphasis on Hibernate, full scripted dev support, as well as the Office and Sharpoint integration features (it also reminds readers about the .NET and Exchange integration features added in to CF 8.)\r\n\r\nSo, it was truly cool to see CF getting some love from the press. More so, being as the press targets a different developer market. But, it got cooler for Adobe with the rest of the issue. See, this issue of VSM was also the 2009 VSM Readers Choice Awards. Adobe took a few honors in several categories:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Help Authoring: Readers Choice Award Winner : RoboHelp and RoboHelp Server - Adobe Systems, Inc.</li>\r\n    <li>Web Design & Development Tools : Readers Choice Award Winner : Dreamweaver - Adobe Systems, Inc.</li>\r\n    <li>Web Design & Development Tools : Readers Choice Merit Award Winner : Creative Suite 4 - Adobe Systms, Inc.</li>\r\n    <li>Web & Mobile Development : Editors Choice Award Winner : Dreamweaver - Adobe Systems, Inc.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nGreat news for Adobe, and a nice shot over the MS bow. Looking over the other categories, I see potential with the release of ColdFusion 9. Here\'s some nice goals/targets for our favorite server:\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Charting and Multimedia (should\'ve been Flex hands down, but CF has it\'s own)</li>\r\n    <li>Data Editing, Reporting &amp; Analysis Tools</li>\r\n    <li>Grid Components: Web (I can see it)</li>\r\n    <li>Imaging and Graphics</li>\r\n    <li>Middleware & Server Based Tools</li>\r\n    <li>PDF Tools</li>\r\n    <li>SharePoint Components & Tooling</li>\r\n    <li>Editors Choice: Most Valuable Tool</li>\r\n    <li>Editors Choice: Data Handling & Development</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThanks Adam, for pushing the tech press in areas that haven\'t historically gotten our message.

 ('35A09DD6-3048-71C2-1720DB7F8B4DF50C','Can We Extend the ColdFusion Server','I love playing around with new toys. So, I\'m ecstatic now that <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 9</a> has been officially released to the world, and even more so after what I\'m about to tell you. Oh sure, I\'ve been playing around with the betas, but mostly in testing the cfajax/ExtJs 3 upgrades (and I\'ll be posting more on that in the coming months). Time has been somewhat limited for me, so playtime has had to take a back burner. But, I wish I had gotten into this a bit sooner.\r\n\r\nYesterday I finally got around to working with some of the new cfscript implementations. I find these upgrades to be one of the key features for me personally. One, It\'s a faster coding style for me. Two, I was getting tired of bouncing between script and tags. Three, I really like the economy of code associated with script, finding it to be far less verbose. So, I\'m lovin\' the fact that I can write all of my CFC\'s, including my Application.cfc, in pure script. Now I can keep the tags with the display. But, as someone pointed out to me in a recent comment, there are still a few tags (anyone know which ones?) that haven\'t yet gotten script implementations. What can we do about that?\r\n\r\nSo, in diving right into playing with script enhancements, I ran into a few roadblocks. Minor errors, stemming from me not properly understanding the implementation. Now, the first place I went was to the documentation. <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ray Camden</a> keeps saying to me \"Why don\'t people read the documentation?\" I\'m one of those that agrees with him. Yes, the documentation has some holes, and even bad examples, but you would be surpised what you can learn. (Read on, you\'ll see where I\'m going with this!)','2009-10-08 15:22:00','In discovering all of this wonderful new scripting, I came across <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/WSe9cbe5cf462523a0693d5dae123bcd28f6d-8000.html\" target=\"_blank\">Script Functions Implemented as CFCs</a> in the new CF 9 CFML Reference. I was stepping through all of the subtopics, when I came upon this little tidbit:\r\n		<blockquote>\r\n			Script functions are available in the following location: cf_root\\CustomTags\\com\\adobe\\coldfusion.\r\n\r\nEnsure that you do not delete the default custom tag mapping listed in the ColdFusion Administrator (Extensions > Custom Tag Paths > Custom tag mappings).\r\n\r\nScript functions work if they are either in the default location or web root. If you have the functions in any other location, add a /com mapping in the ColdFusion Administrator that points to the new location (for example C:\\com).\r\n		</blockquote>\r\n		\r\n		I wasn\'t really surprised by this. Ray had recently alluded to this functionality in his recent post on <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com/index.cfm/2009/9/29/Gotches-with-Queries-in-Script\" target=\"_blank\">Gotchas with Queries in Script</a>. I just hadn\'t thought about it too much. Now, reading the above, a question had smacked me upside the head. <strong><em>Can we extend ColdFusion? Can we write our own \"Script Functions Implemented as CFC\'s?\" Basically create our own server plugins?</em></strong>\r\n\r\nWell, of course we <em>can</em>. We\'ve been able to do that since CF 6, haven\'t we? Written CFC\'s, and used CreateObject()? Placed CFC instances into persistent scopes for broad access? Yes, we have. But I wondered if someone could write a script version of cfsavecontent, and instantiate it anywhere within the application using the <strong>new content();</strong> type of syntax? So, I decided to do a little digging, and a little testing.\r\n\r\n<strong>Side Note:</strong> You must have access to your ColdFusion file system to do the following.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to note, is that all of the functions mentioned, in that set of topics of the CFML Reference, are represented as CFC\'s inside the server\'s default CustomTags folder.\r\n		\r\n		<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n			<img src=\"/images/ct_folder_structure.png\" alt=\"CustomTags Folder Structure\" width=\"427\" height=\"222\" />\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n		The second thing to note, is that these CFC\'s all have init functions that reference the object in dot notation, according to this path:\r\n		\r\n		<code>\r\n			public com.adobe.coldfusion.query function init(){\r\n				...\r\n		</code>\r\n		\r\n		OK, simple enough. So, I wouldn\'t want to utilize the Adobe namespace. Separation would be important for portability. In that case, I\'ll just create my own: com.cutterscrossing.coldfusion. So, if I create a component called \'myComponent\', it\'s initializer would be basically the same:\r\n		\r\n		<code>\r\n			public com.cutterscrossing.coldfusion.myComponent function init(){\r\n				...\r\n		</code>\r\n		\r\n		<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n			<img src=\"/images/ct_folder_structure_2.png\" alt=\"CustomTags Folder Structure w/ new namespace\" width=\"474\" height=\"205\" />\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n		So, I built the myComponent.cfc using the \"New ColdFusion Component\" menu item and wizard within ColdFusion Builder. Output never being exactly what you want, I made the necessary adjustments to get the CFC to where I wanted it: an init() method, with getter and setter functions for firstName, lastName, and emailAddr. I also added a dump() method, that would dump those variables to the screen in the standard cfdump type of layout. Then, I wrote a quick test script:\r\n		\r\n		<code>\r\n<cfsetting enablecfoutputonly=\"true\" />\r\n<cfscript>\r\n	REQUEST.him = new myComponent();\r\n	REQUEST.him.setFirstName(\'Homer\');\r\n	REQUEST.him.setLastName(\'Simpson\');\r\n	REQUEST.him.setEmailAddr(\'homer@duffbeer.com\');\r\n</cfscript>\r\n<cfoutput>\r\n<html>\r\n	<head>\r\n	<title>Something</title>\r\n	</head>\r\n	<body>\r\n		#REQUEST.him.dump()#\r\n	</body>\r\n</html>\r\n</cfoutput>\r\n<cfsetting enablecfoutputonly=\"false\" />\r\n		</code>\r\n		\r\n		Well, I hit the page, and...it died. Well, I keep forgetting to kill the template and component caching settings in my ColdFusion Administrator (a must on your development and staging servers). After resolving all of that, I hit my template again (drum roll, please):\r\n		\r\n		<div style=\"text-align:center;\">\r\n			<img src=\"/images/ct_dumpmethod.png\" alt=\"CustomTags Folder Structure w/ new namespace\" width=\"198\" height=\"94\" />\r\n		</div>\r\n		\r\n		Voila! \"So,\" you might ask, \"what does all of that mean?\" Well, after some truly diligent study of the objects already in the Adobe namespace, it means that <strong>you</strong> can extend the ColdFusion server. It would be best to move the server\'s CustomTags folder first (adjusting the mapping), so that any additions wouldn\'t accidentally get wiped out with an update or anything, but it could be done.\r\n\r\n	\r\n		There are many different possible applications, from writing script versions for the few remaining tags, to creating your own scripted function objects (for instance: write a scripted function object for converting video to flv format).

 ('EB228803-3048-71C2-177B3A1EB3BB6BB1','Out With The Old, In With The New: 2009 - 2010','Wow! Where has all the time gone? This morning I\'m looking back on 2009, and it has flown by. We\'ve watched our banks collapse, and our government bail them out. We\'ve watched the housing market go to pot, and friends and family have lost their homes. We\'ve seen congress attempt to pump life into a social health care program, and watched it divide a nation. We\'ve seen the auto industry grind to a halt, and seen iconic brands completely shut their doors. It\'s been a depressing year.\r\n\r\nI think many of us have had a hard time keeping a positive attitude this past year. I know that the early part of the second half of this year I saw my own morale hit lows, the uncertainty making me moody and impatient. I was waiting for something (anything) positive to happen. You can see it on this blog as well, when you see that the last post made was in October, and I never even touted the release of <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 9</a> (which is well worth blogging about). But, things have changed.\r\n\r\nA few months back, I had a personal epiphany. I reminded myself that change is only affected through action. My inaction was pulling me down, not really adversely affecting my work or family (yet), but not doing anything to improve my conditions either. So, I woke up. I decided that I would be my own positive force for change. I apologized to those I worked with, and vowed to find my inner motivation, to move forward with purpose, and challenged them all to do the same.\r\n\r\nIn that time, my shift in thought, word, and action has brought about personal change and growth. I have consciously worked to change my own personal perspective of each situation, to take on each new challenge as an opportunity, and to give more of myself to others with a servant\'s heart. I have, once again, realized that happiness begins with a decision; knowing that the only person\'s thoughts and actions that I can control are my own. I can influence others, through my words and actions, but I can not control them. If I maintain a path of right thinking and right feeling and right doing, then that influence can be a positive influence, and I will be happier for doing what is right.\r\n\r\nSo, where have I been? Well, I took the time to read some fiction. I generally read one fiction title a year, but this time I read fourteen (in a row). I also took in some self-help and leadership titles that I\'ve been putting on hold for a while. I did some work on my open source <a href=\"http://cfqueryreader.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">CFQueryReader</a> project, put in a topic for cf.Objective() 2010, and committed to updating <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js/book\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Learning Ext JS</em></a> for a 2<sup>nd</sup> Edition around the changes in the <a href=\"http://www.extjs.com\" target=\"_blank\">ExtJs 3.x</a> releases (with more ColdFusion examples).\r\n\r\nAt work, we\'ve undertaken a key rewrite of our most important front-end application, which has been exciting, challenging, and rewarding. We have several high priority projects that we are completing prior to a major conference in February. Currently, we\'re hiring for several positions, with a very active interview process. And, most recently, my boss decided to pursue other interests, and I have taken on the interim Development Manager position. This alone has been a major transition, with many extreme shifts in my basic duties and responsibilities, but has been very exciting and rewarding as well. It helps to have such an outstanding team, within Development, as well as so many great people who work with us day to day.\r\n\r\nLast night, my wife and daughter having fallen asleep already, I was standing on our back deck at the stroke of Midnight. All around the neighborhood I could hear cheers and singing, while fireworks were going off left and right. I stood there, staring up in the darkness, and said a prayer The Father. I prayed for the strength and wisdom to approach the coming challenges of this new year. I prayed for the vision to see each new opportunity, and the will and courage to act when necessary (and the understanding on when not too). I prayed for patience and guidance, in discovering what new paths I am meant to walk upon. I prayed for the health and well being of my family and friends, that they might continually have love, life, and prosperity. And I prayed that everyone would endeavor to improve their own understanding, of themselves and their fellow man, so that we might all create a better world in 2010. If everyone endeavors to become better, and do what they can to make life better for those around them, then we can make this world a better place.\r\n\r\nHappy New Year everyone!

Great things are here!\r\n\r\nOn June 14<sup>th</sup>, Ext JS LLC <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/06/14/ext-js-jqtouch-raphael-sencha/\" target=\"_blank\">rebranded</a> as part of their announced partnership with the principles of the <a href=\"http://www.jqtouch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JQTouch</a> and <a href=\"http://raphaeljs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Raphael</a> projects, creating <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sencha</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/js/\" target=\"_blank\">Ext JS</a> library is still one of their major offerings, but they have also created Sencha Labs as a repository of various Open Source Projects under the MIT License (Like JQTouch, Raphael, and <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/core/\" target=\"_blank\">Ext Core</a>). Great things were on the way!\r\n\r\nHaving David Kaneda (JQTouch) and Dmitry Baranovskiy (Raphael) join forces with the Ext JS crew is huge, and really plays well in understanding a series of recent <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/\" target=\"_blank\">blog posts</a> around <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/05/23/html5-now-with-20-percent-more-internet/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML5</a>, <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/06/01/the-html5-family-css3/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS3</a>, and what <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/06/11/html5-is-here-now-its-just-not-for-your-desktop-yet/\" target=\"_blank\">HTML5 means to developers today</a>. But, it gets better.\r\n\r\nThis morning, Sencha launched their first joint product in public beta, <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/\" target=\"_blank\">Sencha Touch</a>. Sencha Touch is a cross-platform mobile application framework built to leverage HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. It gives you the same sort of consistent API that you\'ve come to expect from the Ext JS team, with a familiar syntax, great documentation, user forums for support, and many samples included with the download to help you learn. I\'ve had the opportunity to preview this code for a while, and it is outstanding work. There will be some interesting apps to come out of this.\r\n\r\nThe future looks bright for Sencha, and I can\'t wait to see what they do next. Judging from their post on the rebranding, my prediction are changes to ExtDesigner (possibly to become SenchaDesigner), that would allow a developer to build both Ext JS and Sencha Touch interfaces from the same tool. My guess. (Man, that would be really cool.)','2010-06-17 17:31:00',NULL,'Introducing-Sencha','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',2344,1,1,'','','',''),

One of my guys came to me earlier this week with one I had made myself a few years back. Something so simple, yet easily overlooked. Now, this guy has been writing <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> for years, yet breezed right over it, assuming things acted one way when they acted completely another.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfparam name=\"REQUEST.base\" default=\"\" type=\"string\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nSo, fairly simple, right? My guy expected REQUEST.base to be an empty string. But it wasn\'t. Why? Well, in an earlier part of the process was another cfparam tag:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfparam name=\"REQUEST.base\" default=\"#CGI.query_string#\" type=\"string\" />\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe code in the first block was in a template that, in this case, was nested within another template (via cfinclude) that contained the second code block in it\'s head. So CGI.query_string was already assigned to REQUEST.base. What one has to remember is that, with cfparam, the default is only applied to the variable if the variable <i>does not already exist</i>. If the variable already exists, then the cfparam tag has no effect. Basically this is just like writing something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n<cfparam name=\"REQUEST.base\" default=\"\" type=\"string\" />\r\n<!--- The same as --->\r\n<cfif not StructKeyExists(REQUEST,\"base\")>\r\n	<cfset REQUEST.base = \"\" />\r\n</cfif>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nPersonally, I prefer the cfparam ;) (less code) Now, my guy was expecting an empty string, and was baffled as to why some other code wasn\'t processing properly. Once we sat down to dig in further, he saw that the value was not an empty string, and went about trying to figure out why it had a value. His confusion and frustration turned into anger over such a rookie hit, but everybody does it at some point.','2010-11-26 21:40:00',NULL,'Rookie-Mistakes-cfparam','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1910,1,1,'','','',''),

I took over managing both the Systems and the Development Team, at a time when there wasn\'t much team left. This began a long, arduous task of recruiting and hiring, and by the end of the year I had hired three ColdFusion developers, one User Interface/User Experience specialist, one SQL developer, one desktop administrator, and one systems administrator. Along with this we took on the completion of four major projects with very short deadlines. These had begun prior to me taking the new position, and were out the door fairly close to schedule, but with the fun that accompanies projects that are poorly planned ahead of time. One of them had a necessary last minute technology change on client-side rendering, which happened very quickly but dragged our testing and deployment schedule immensely. I even pushed through a switch on our mapping application at the last minute, to use Google\'s JavaScript v3 Maps API, which I actually got to write myself (you don\'t write much code in management).\r\n\r\n2010 also brought my new book, <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js-3-2-for-building-dynamic-desktop-style-user-interfaces/book\" target=\"_blank\">Learning Ext JS 3.2</a>. Due to some scheduling issues with one of the other authors, the book was released way behind schedule, finally arriving just weeks prior to the Sencha Conference. ExtLLC became <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sencha</a>, who released their new <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/touch/\" target=\"_blank\">Sencha Touch</a> framework for mobile development. During the Sencha Conference they also showed some sneaks of the upcoming <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/2010/11/22/ext-js-4-preview-faster-easier-more-stable/\" target=\"_blank\">Ext JS 4</a>; a rewrite of most of the existing framework making it leaner, meaner, faster, better. Hey look! New book material ;)\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> had some killer announcements as well. After <a href=\"http://www.apple.com\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> had banned new apps to the AppStore from cross compilers, Adobe turned around and focused heavily on the Android platform, releasing some very nice tool enhancements for creating mobile content, as well as getting the Flash Player into the Android Marketplace. Later in the year, Apple reversed their cross-compiler position, and Adobe immediately began to work again on tools for creating mobile content on the iOS platform. Unfortunately for me, I was so heavily entrenched at the office that I didn\'t get to spend near enough time playing with these new developments (Adobe or Sencha). That\'s about to change though...\r\n\r\nIn my new role, as a manager, I had hoped to have the ability to drive technical change in a positive direction. Unfortunately, events that long preceded my taking the position worked hard to prevent that momentum, and many of the decisions were no longer mine to make. This, coupled with the drain on my time, my family, and my ability to do the things that I enjoy, were taking a heavy toll on my personal well being. Time had finally come for a change.\r\n\r\nDecember was a very interesting month. First I recieved an offer for a new opportunity, once again doing full time development, but this time as a telecommuter with flex schedule. I wasn\'t looking at the time, but it kind of came to me, and appeared a perfect fit. I resigned my management position, with the customary two week notice. This was bittersweet, as I had devoted a lot of time and effort to the company over the past five years, but this new opp was too good to pass up, and works with a vertical that\'s very near and dear to my heart. On a Friday I said goodbye, and the following Monday went to work with the new gig for a week before taking 10 days of pre-planned family fun for my daughter\'s birthday and the Christmas holiday.\r\n\r\nNow that my time is settling back into some semblence of a groove, I once again have some time to re-devote to the different development communities I enjoy being a part of. <a href=\"http://tdg-i.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Jay Garcia</a> recently asked me to convert his book\'s Ext JS examples over to ColdFusion for some of his readers.

Not copies of that codebase mind you, but one actual set of code templates. Update a template to fix a bug or add a feature and...? Presto! You\'ve just updated X number of sites at once. Genius! Or is it?','2011-01-13 18:32:00','There are a <b><i>lot</i></b> of things you must consider when writing this type of application. In this series of posts I want to discuss the concept thoroughly. And I say \"discuss\" because there is always more than one way to skin a cat, and there are definitely some developers out there reading this that are smarter than I am. Running many sites off a single codebase can be very tricky, and it\'s not something you should \"just do\" without some serious consideration. It isn\'t something you would do in every situation, and there are some serious pitfalls you would want to avoid, especially in terms of scalability.\r\n\r\nAlong the way I\'ll be including code. It will be written for <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> 9, but in most cases could be adjusted for earlier server versions. I\'ll also make suggestions on architecture such as file system structure, web and app server configurations, error handling, and more. Remember that none of this is gospel, but merely suggestions, as every environment and application are different. I also welcome any feedback along the way on ideas for better architecture.\r\n\r\n<h2>Consideration: Server</h2>\r\n\r\nWhen running multiple sites from a single codebase, my first recommendation is that you use a dedicated server instance. This provides some degree of sandboxing, allowing one to do some things that you wouldn\'t ordinarily do in most environments. Best to work with a VPS or a dedicated machine. I would also suggest using a 64-bit system with a 64-bit JVM and 64-bit ColdFusion. 32-bit systems limit your RAM utilization, because a 32-bit JVM can only access about 1.4 GB of RAM. This can fill up very quickly with multiple applications (each site is it\'s own application) and thousands or more user sessions. Using a 64-bit JVM will allow you to allocate more RAM to your ColdFusion instance, meaning you can run more applications/sites and accomodate more concurrent users. For these examples I\'ll be using the <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Apache Webserver</a> and the JRun J2EE server used by the default ColdFusion Multi-Instance setup. I have a series of (dated) <a href=\"/index.cfm/2007/7/23/Local-Development-Setup-Pt-1-Apache-and-ColdFusion-7-or-8\" target=\"_blank\">posts on creating Multi-Instance setups on Apache</a> that you can follow (with modern Apache adjustments) to help you get your initial server configurations in place, though you can just as easily use IIS for your webserver, or <a href=\"http://tomcat.apache.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Tomcat</a> or <a href=\"http://jboss.org/\" target=\"_blank\">JBoss</a> for your J2EE server.\r\n\r\n<h2>Consideration: Scope Usage</h2>\r\n\r\nOne major consideration, when creating a MSOC (Many Sites, One Codebase) environment are the decisions we make about persistent scope usage. Every time we consider what scope to use for a variable, it is imperative to weigh the pros and cons of where that variable will live. You may quickly find that a variable you might typically put in the session scope really belongs in the application scope, or that an application variable you\'ve been using could be part of the server scope because it\'s used by every application (this is one of the reasons it is best to use a dedicated server instance). Another consideration is your object usage. We all want to write better applications, and an MVC architecture and frameworks are very appealing. But most frameworks can be very object intensive, and aren\'t necessarily the best choice in an MSOC environment.\r\n\r\nWhen considering persistent scope, you also have to consider your server/RAM overhead very carefully. I\'ve used a User object in the session scope many times in the past, but we have to consider the memory footprint of that object. How many concurrent users might be in each app at any given time? Do I really need a User object? Or can I get by with a small, basic struct? If I have a million concurrent users across multiple applications, what does the memory footprint look like? Can I shift a variable to a better scope, and reduce my memory utilization without negatively impacting my application? By placing this object in this scope, have I verified that it\'s thread safe? All are important things to consider.\r\n\r\n<h2>What\'s Next?</h2>\r\n\r\nOur next post we\'ll start to look at setting up the file system and web server for our sites. We\'ll talk about some code organization specific to an MSOC environment, and some architecture considerations. If you have any suggestions, comments, or questions, please post a comment and I\'ll either answer it here of in another post.','Many-Sites-One-Codebase','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1941,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('910BD462-3048-71C2-17F6EA5497569EC1','MSOC Part 2 - Web Server Configuration','When you\'re writing an application to run on multiple domains, but using a single copy of code, the first thing you have to work out is your Web Server Configuration. Basically there will be a DNS entry for each domain pointed to your server\'s IP Address. Then your web server will have to be configured to handle those domains. Rarely, in an MSOC environment, will you need a separate site entry for each site you\'re serving, requiring one entry to serve all sites. If you\'re working with IIS on Windows you could just use the Default Web Site entry in your IIS manager. Apache is a little different.','2011-01-17 06:16:09','If you followed along with the <a href=\"/index.cfm/2007/7/23/Local-Development-Setup-Pt-1-Apache-and-ColdFusion-7-or-8\" target=\"_blank\">setup posts</a> on setting up your environment for multi-instance, you created several VirtualHost entries to point different domains to different instances of <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a>. The path you choose next depends on two things: 1) Will you ever serve another domain on this system served by different code? And 2) are each of your domains entirely unique? Or are the just subdomains of the same root domain? (These questions are relevant on Windows as well, and treated similarly)\r\n\r\nLet\'s say that all of your sites will be subdomains of the same root domain. This configuration gets pretty simple, as all you\'d need to do is setup another VirtualHost entry.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n# Setup - MultiHome Instance\r\n<VirtualHost *:80>\r\n    ServerName primary.multihome.loc\r\n    ServerAlias *.multihome.loc\r\n    # The next include file contains the entries for the \r\n    # ColdFusion instance to use with these sites\r\n    Include conf/extra/multihome_CF.conf\r\n    DocumentRoot \"C:/Inetpub/wwwroot/multihome\"\r\n    <Directory \"C:/Inetpub/wwwroot/multihome\">\r\n        Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews ExecCGI\r\n        AllowOverride All\r\n        Order allow,deny\r\n        Allow from all\r\n    </Directory>\r\n    DirectoryIndex index.cfm index.html\r\n    ServerAdmin web.admin@mydomain.com\r\n    ErrorLog \"multihome.loc-error.log\"\r\n    CustomLog \"multihome.loc-access.log\" common\r\n</VirtualHost>\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAfter that the \'multihome\' directory would be the root directory for every site using the \'multihome.loc\' root domain. This is accomplished through the \'ServerAlias\' attribute of your VirtualHost configuration.\r\n\r\nNow let\'s say that you\'re using many different domain names, or that maybe you will also run some other sites on the server as well (not recommended). In this scenario, like IIS, you\'ll need to run these sites off the default site configuration. As I mentioned before, on IIS this means configuring the Default Web Site entry. Apache has something very similar.\r\n\r\nHave you ever really read the httpd.conf file from your Apache install?

If DNS for a domain is pointed to your server, and a VirtualHost declaration does not exist for that domain, then these settings will control that requested site. These are the defaults used by all sites on the system (VirtualHosts and otherwise). VirtualHost declarations override these settings on a per domain basis. I am not an expert on Apache, in any way, so you will have to carefully review these settings to determine what is necessary, and what should be stricken for your own server\'s protection. To point these undeclared sites to your MSOC codebase, the only true change needed is to change the DocumentRoot declaration to point to the \'multihome\' folder, and ensure that the JRunConfig Bootstrap attribute is pointed to the port of the ColdFusion instance you intend to use for your sites.\r\n\r\nUsing the Default Web Site of your web server is the \'easy way\' of handling configuration, as you do it once and control it in a single location. This will not work in all situations.

 ('9B4C0BCF-3048-71C2-17FB91839F1C86F5','New Custom Tag for Google Maps: CFGMap','Two years back I had to write a new mapping implementation for my former employer, who wanted to move away from MapQuest. We chose Google Maps, for a number of reasons. I wrote the implementation using <a href=\"http://www.scottmebberson.com\" target=\"_blank\">Scott Mebberson\'s</a> implementation, the <a href=\"http://www.googlemapstag.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps Tag</a>. I was quick and easy, and ultimately we had to ditch it at the last minute. Why? Google\'s licensing at the time was too restrictive for our use case. Running almost 2,000 sites of of one codebase, we would have had to get a separate license key for each site, or get an enterprise license through Google. We were going down that path originally, but the cost at the time was almost $40k, and required some work on their part that they couldn\'t make our deadline (during the holidays), so when the autorenewal kicked in on (cheaper) MapQuest we just rolled with it.\r\n\r\nLast month my former employer once again wanted to get rid of MapQuest. First we looked at our implementation, realizing that the same hurdles were in place. Next we looked at <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion 9\'s</a> new cfmap tags. That implementation works the same way, requiring the API key per domain. Luckily, I remembered seeing a tweet from someone about changes to Google\'s Maps API. A change that wouldn\'t require an API key anymore. So, I went to check it out.\r\n\r\nThe latest version of the <a href=\"\" target=\"_blank\">Google Maps Javascript API</a> is very nice, and has one very significant change.\r\n\r\n<quote>\r\nThe JavaScript Maps API V3 is a free service, available for any web site that is free to consumers. \r\n</quote>\r\n\r\nThis was perfect, as all of our sites were free to consumers. The first thing I did was try to make some adjustments to my initial implementation from Scott\'s tags. This didn\'t work, as there were some major differences in Google\'s new implementation. I ended up rewriting the entire implementation to work with the new API, creating my own custom tag. In forking Scott\'s code, I had to keep the <a href=\"http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\" target=\"_blank\">license</a> the same, which allows me to put it back out to the community at large (and with the approval of my old boss).\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://cfgmap.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">CFGMap</a> is now available on <a href=\"http://www.riaforge.org\" target=\"_blank\">RIAForge</a> for download. My <a href=\"http://examples.cutterscrossing.com/cfgmap\" target=\"_blank\">simple example</a> source code is included with the download, and all code is heavily documented. My example uses <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a> for the basic DOM manipulation involved, but JQuery is not required to use the tag itself. You\'ll want to pay special attention to the <a href=\"http://examples.cutterscrossing.com/CFGMap/scripts/testmap.js\" target=\"_blank\">testmap.js</a> file, which shows how you can access your map object to plot directions and stuff. The tag puts a map on the page, and plots the points you\'ve fed to it. It will even trigger a callback method, that you define, for passing lat/lng info that\'s been goelocated back to your database, reducing the geolocation hits on subsequent map visits.\r\n\r\nIt\'s only the first go-around with the updated library, and I\'m sure that changes will need to be made at some point. I welcome any and all feedback, questions, and suggestions.','2011-01-18 17:40:00',NULL,'New-Custom-Tag-for-Google-Maps-CFGMap','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1781,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('B7C6D16D-3048-71C2-1750AE041124E8CB','MSOC Part 3: Setting Up Your Applications','In part two we setup our web server to handle trafficing multiple domains to our single codebase, but now we have to get our applications setup. This is where we have to start thinking about separation. Since each domain is driven off the same set of physical files, we now have to consider how we separate one domain\'s sessions/actions/resources from another. You don\'t want one user\'s session to be cross domain in any way, and it wouldn\'t be good to have the media assets of one site displaying on another. Where do we begin? With the code.','2011-01-24 06:17:00','<h2>Architecture Consideration: Utilizing The Server Scope</h2>\r\n\r\nIn most situations we would not utilize the Server scope, as any variables stored in the Server scope are available to every application on that server instance. In an MSOC situation, this works to our advantage, if used properly. If thought out, you can use the Server scope to store variables and objects that <em>would</em> be used by every application, such as shared datasource names, utility objects, error handler objects and more. By storing them in the Server scope there is only a single instance of these variables on the server instance at a time, rather than duplicating them across every application. Say you have a utility object that, when instantiated, takes up 100 KB of memory. If your server has 2,000 active applications, and that object were stored in the Application scope, that becomes 200 MB of memory. By storing it in the Server scope you use only the 100 KB, leaving more memory for active applications and sessions. <strong>Big Note:</strong> Ensuring thread safety, of objects stored in the Server scope, is absolutely vital.\r\n    \r\n    Before <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> 9, we would want to put Server scope initialization code within our onApplicationStart() method.\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n<cffunction name=\"onApplicationStart\" output=\"false\" access=\"public\" returntype=\"boolean\">\r\n	<cfif not StructKeyExists(SERVER,\"dsn\")>\r\n    	<cflock scope=\"SERVER\" timeout=\"5\" type=\"exclusive\">\r\n        	<cfset SERVER.dsn = StructNew() />\r\n            <cfset SERVER.dsn.multihome = \"multihome\" />\r\n            <cfset SERVER.dsn.users = \"users\" />\r\n        </cflock>\r\n    </cfif>\r\n    <cfif not StructKeyExists(SERVER,\"cfc\")>\r\n        <cflock scope=\"SERVER\" timeout=\"5\" type=\"exclusive\">\r\n        	<cfset SERVER.cfc = StructNew() />\r\n            <cfset SERVER.cfc.GeneralUtility = createObject(\"component\",\"com.multihome.GeneralUtility\").init() />\r\n            <cfset SERVER.cfc.ErrorHandler = createObject(\"component\",\"com.multihome.ErrorHandler\").init(SERVER.dns.multihome) />\r\n        </cflock>\r\n    </cfif>\r\n</cffunction>\r\n	</code>\r\n\r\nThis adds a little overhead to application initialization and creates a lot of unnecessary code at the applicatin level, but has worked fine for previous versions of ColdFusion. Now, with ColdFusion 9, we can utilize server.cfc and the onServerStart() method for this scenario. First, you\'ll want to define a unique location for your multisite instance version of server.cfc. Logging in to the ColdFusion Administrator for your multisite instance, and going to the <em>Settings</em> page, you will find an option to define a specific location for that instance\'s server.cfc. In this situation, I created a <em>config</em> folder outside of my webroot, defined the location in the administrator, and placed the server.cfc in the folder.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"ColdFusion Administrator | Settings page | Server.cfc location\" width=\"973\" height=\"73\" src=\"/images/2011-01-24_0521.png\" />\r\n\r\nAfter the cfc\'s location is defined, we can move code for Server variable declaration in to the onServerStart() method.\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n/**\r\n *	  CLASS/TEMPLATE\r\n *	  server.cfc\r\n *\r\n *    @output false\r\n */\r\n component {\r\n\r\n    /**\r\n     *    FUNCTION onServerStart\r\n     *    Runs when an application is first initialized\r\n     *    http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/WS7AC9408A-1AC6-4ab7-9C8E-CF1DA8FCA16D.html\r\n     *    @access public\r\n     *    @returnType boolean\r\n     *    @output false\r\n     */\r\n	function onServerStart() {\r\n        SERVER.dns = {};\r\n        SERVER.dns.multihome = \"multihome\";\r\n        SERVER.dns.users = \"users\";\r\n        SERVER.cfc = {};\r\n        SERVER.cfc.GeneralUtility = createObject(\"component\",\"com.multihome.GeneralUtility\").init();\r\n        SERVER.cfc.AppConfig = createObject(\"component\",\"com.multihome.AppConfig\").init(SERVER.dns.multihome);\r\n        return true;\r\n	}\r\n\r\n}\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nOnce your server.cfc is in place in the folder you defined in your ColdFusion Administrator, and the server instance is restarted, the onServerStart() method is executed within the object and these Server scoped variables become available to every application defined on that instance. It is very important to note that, should you make any additions or changes to this method (for new variables, or removing unused ones) that they will not become available to your applications until the server is restarted. It is also very important to unit test any objects prior to putting them here, as it is much more difficult to track errors here. Proper error handling on object instantiation can be critical to getting your server up, so you might start thinking strategy now.\r\n\r\nNow that we\'ve defined some things used by all applications, let\'s focus a little on the applications themselves. In order to run MSOC you have to consider dynamic application naming. This is vital to separate one domain from another. Most of us, writing out our application.cfc, place code in the constructor that defines our application (this.dataSource = X). What some don\'t realize is that this code runs on every single page request, or that you can dynamically change those values at runtime from within the other functions of your application.cfc. Others fail to realize that you can also add additional functions to your application.cfc, that only run when called upon. This is helpful in encapsulating small bits of code to specific tasks, and not peppering your application.cfc with unnecesary variables that only need to live as long as the function.\r\n\r\nLet\'s create a new method in our application.cfc, applicationSetup(), that we\'ll use to dynamically set our application name. We\'ll make our method return our application name based upon the url, and set our application name from the return of the method.\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\nTHIS.name = applicationSetup(CGI);\r\n\r\n/**\r\n *    FUNCTION applicationSetup\r\n *    Set app specific properties in an MSOC environment\r\n *    @access private\r\n *    @returnType string\r\n *    @output true\r\n */\r\n function applicationSetup(required cgiScope) {\r\n     var tmp = 0;\r\n     var errorMessage = \"An error has occurred in initializing your application. Please contact your Support Team representative.\";\r\n     try {\r\n         tmp = SERVER.cfc.AppConfig.getSiteIdByUrl(cgiScope.server_name);\r\n         if (tmp.success and (StructKeyExists(tmp,\"queryResult\") and tmp.queryResult.recordCount)) {\r\n             return \"site_\" & tmp.queryResult.siteId;\r\n         } else {\r\n             throw (type = \"MH_Custom\", errorCode = \"001\", message = \"The site \" & CGI.server_name & \" is not setup in our system.\");\r\n         }\r\n     } catch (any excpt) {\r\n         if (excpt.type eq \"MH_Custom\") {\r\n             errorMessage = excpt.message;\r\n         }\r\n         WriteOutput(\"<h1>\" & errorMessage & \"</h1>\");\r\n         abort;\r\n     }\r\n }\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nWe passed the CGI scope into the applicationSetup() method and called the <em>AppConfig.cfc</em> to query the database for the siteId of the url. If an id was returned then we return the application name based upon the siteId. If none was returned, we assume it isn\'t a part of our system and tell that to the user before aborting further operations.\r\n\r\nThis is only the beginning, and there are many different ways of going about it. For instance, you could have the <em>config</em> folder as a ColdFusion mapping in the administrator, and use .ini files for configuration settings of each domain. I would use a single datasource for all domains, as you can make db additions/changes for all sites simultaneously, as you do with the code. However, some people choose to use a separate datasource per domain, for portability, faster read times, and easy per site maintenance. Everything here is a <em>suggestion</em> of how to procede with an MSOC environment, and opening discussion on ways to address different aspects. Have a comment? Suggestion? Let me know what you think? (Source code for this example is available through the Download link at the bottom of this post. A script for setting up the MySQL datasource used for the example is located in the config/DB_Scripts folder.)','MSOC-Part-3-Setting-Up-Your-Applications','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1379,1,1,'','','',''),

In fact, I love cfscript, and prefer to script as much as I can. <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> 9 created a <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/Developing/WSe9cbe5cf462523a02805926a1237efcbfd5-8000.html\" target=\"_blank\">much greater degree of parity between cftags and cfscript</a>. Unfortunately, the events of the past year and a half have left me with few opportunities to work on ColdFusion 9, so I\'m playing catch-up on some of these great new enhancements. I did <a href=\"/index.cfm/2009/10/8/Scripting-a-ColdFusion-Application\">script the application.cfc</a> back in October of 2009, but aside from that I was buried in writing a book, new job responsibilities, and more. I\'m working to write all future ColdFusion examples in as much script as possible, but I still hit the occassional hurdle and ask for help.\r\n\r\nSo, while writing my examples for <a href=\"/index.cfm/2011/1/24/MSOC-Part-3-Setting-Up-Your-Applications\">my last post</a>, I kept hitting a snag while scripting a query. After banging my head on the wall for a while, I finally pinged <a href=\"http://www.coldfusionjedi.com\" target=\"_blank\">the ColdFusionJedi himself</a> for assistance. Ray probably though I was off my nutter, having never scripted a <a href=\"http://help.adobe.com/en_US/ColdFusion/9.0/CFMLRef/WSe9cbe5cf462523a0693d5dae123bcd28f6d-7ffb.html\" target=\"_blank\">query</a>, but we did run into something worth talking about.\r\n\r\nFirst, I\'ve gotten into a habit of scoping querynames. Why? If you didn\'t (in ColdFusion 8 or earlier) they were part of the VARIABLES scope. This can give you unintentional results, if you aren\'t careful, so I\'d gotten into scoping querynames.\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n    <cffunction name=\"getSiteId\" output=\"false\" access=\"public\" returntype=\"struct\">\r\n    	<cfargument name=\"cgiScope\" required=\"true\" type=\"struct\" />\r\n        <cfset var LOCAL = StructNew() />\r\n        <cfset LOCAL.retVal = StructNew() />\r\n        <cfset LOCAL.retVal[\'success\'] = true />\r\n        <cftry>\r\n        	<cfquery name=\"LOCAL.qSiteId\" datasource=\"#VARIABLES.instance.dsn#\">\r\n            	SELECT	siteId\r\n                FROM	sites\r\n                WHERE	urlAddress = <cfqueryparam cfsqltype=\"cf_sql_varchar\" value=\"#ARGUMENTS.cgiScope.server_name#\" />\r\n            </cfquery>\r\n            <cfif LOCAL.qSiteId.recordCount>\r\n            	<cfset LOCAL.retVal[\'result\'] = LOCAL.qSiteId />\r\n            <cfelse>\r\n            	<cfthrow type=\"My_Custom\" errorcode=\"001\" message=\"No siteId was found for this domain.\" />\r\n            </cfif>\r\n            <cfcatch type=\"any\">\r\n            	<cfset LOCAL.retVal[\'success\'] = false />\r\n                <cfset LOCAL.retVal[\'message\'] = CFCATCH.message />\r\n                <!--- Any other error handling --->\r\n            </cfcatch>\r\n        </cftry>\r\n        <cfreturn LOCAL.retVal />\r\n    </cffunction>\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nWe\'ll come back to that in just a minute. I also like to pass <em>argumentCollection</em>s into functions. Maybe it\'s just me, but it\'s something I do. So, I created a collection to pass into the constructor of a new Query.\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n    // THIS DIDN\'T WORK!!!\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     *    FUNCTION getSiteIdByUrl\r\n     *    @access public\r\n     *    @returnType struct\r\n     *    @output false\r\n     */\r\n    function getSiteIdByUrl(required struct cgiScope) {\r\n        LOCAL.retVal = {};\r\n        LOCAL.retVal[\'success\'] = true;\r\n        LOCAL.qPrms = {};\r\n        LOCAL.qPrms.name = \"LOCAL.qSiteId\";\r\n        LOCAL.qPrms.datasource = VARIABLES.instance.dsn;\r\n        LOCAL.qPrms.sql = \"SELECT siteId\r\n            FROM sites\r\n            WHERE UrlAddress = :urlAddress\";\r\n        LOCAL.q = new Query(argumentCollection = LOCAL.qPrms);\r\n        LOCAL.q.addParam(name = \"urlAddress\", value = ARGUMENTS.cgiScope.urlAddress,\r\n cfsqltype = \"cf_sql_varchar\");\r\n 		try {\r\n        	LOCAL.retVal[\'queryResult\'] = LOCAL.q.execute();\r\n            if (!LOCAL.retVal.queryResult.recordCount) {\r\n            	throw (type = \"My_Custom\",errorcode = \"001\",message = \"No siteId was found for this domain.\");\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (any excpt) {\r\n        	LOCAL.retVal[\'success\'] = false;\r\n            LOCAL.retVal[\'message\'] = excpt.message;\r\n            // other error handling here\r\n        }\r\n        return LOCAL.retVal;\r\n    }\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nAlright, it seems to look OK, right? So why is it erroring? Well, Ray first told me to break it down some. Make it simple, remove the param, stuff like that. No dice. Then he said use getResult() after the execute statement. Uh huh. Then I decided to take the LOCAL scope out (it\'s local anyway, right?) Still no dice. Finally Ray said \"Don\'t use argumentCollection.\" Use the <em>set</em> methods instead. Bam! It worked! I thanked Ray for the assist, and went back to recreating the full function.\r\n\r\nWhoops! Not working again. Could not find retVal.qSiteId in LOCAL (or something like that). Now what? But then I saw I had put the LOCAL scope <em>back</em> on the query name. Took it off, and it worked like a charm.\r\n\r\n    <code>\r\n    //	THIS WORKS GREAT!\r\n    \r\n    /**\r\n     *    FUNCTION getSiteIdByUrl\r\n     *    @access public\r\n     *    @returnType struct\r\n     *    @output false\r\n     */\r\n    function getSiteIdByUrl(required struct cgiScope) {\r\n        var retVal = {};\r\n        retVal[\'success\'] = true;\r\n        var sql = \"\";\r\n        var q = new Query();\r\n        q.setName(\"qSiteId\");\r\n        q.setDatasource(VARIABLES.instance.dsn);\r\n        sql = \"SELECT siteId\r\n            FROM sites\r\n            WHERE UrlAddress = :urlAddress\";\r\n        q.setSQL(sql);\r\n        q.addParam(name = \"urlAddress\", value = ARGUMENTS.cgiScope.urlAddress,\r\n cfsqltype = \"cf_sql_varchar\");\r\n 		try {\r\n        	retVal[\'queryResult\'] = q.execute().getResult();\r\n            if (!retVal.queryResult.recordCount) {\r\n            	throw(type = \"My_Custom\",errorcode = \"001\",message = \"No siteId was found for this domain.\");\r\n            }\r\n        } catch (any excpt) {\r\n        	retVal[\'success\'] = false;\r\n            retVal[\'message\'] = excpt.message;\r\n            // other error handling here\r\n        }\r\n        return retVal;\r\n    }\r\n    </code>\r\n\r\nNow, I should go back and test argumentCollection without the LOCAL scope on the query name, but for now I\'m just happy that it works. I really do love scripting, and see where this really brings ColdFusion (once again) to another level as a language choice.','2011-01-24 17:12:00',NULL,'Scripted-Noob-Queries-and-Issues','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1472,1,1,'','','',''),

(I tried to put an onMissingMethod() into an Application.cfc, and force a call by calling an undefined method from my constructor, but it just errored out. Guess that method is only for standard cfc\'s.) In the next few articles we\'ll go further in depth on some uses of each of these event handlers, but for now we\'ll discuss what can happen outside of these methods.\r\n\r\n<h2>A Little Of THIS And A Little Of That</h2>\r\n\r\nWithin your Application.cfc you have functions and metadata (the stuff in comments outside of functions), and then there\'s everything else. Application definition occurs mostly outside of these functions (THIS.name = \"foo\"; THIS.datasource = \"bar\") in the <em>constructor</em>. Not that you can\'t manipulate those variables in your functions. In fact, there are some very valid use cases for manipulating THIS variables in the various request functions, but for now let\'s talk about their use and the <em>constructor</em>.\r\n\r\nCode within the constructor executes without calling a function, and prior to any of the events being fired. In <a href=\"/index.cfm/2011/1/24/MSOC-Part-3-Setting-Up-Your-Applications\">our last post</a> we dynamically set our application name in the <em>constructor</em> prior to any events being fired. And, in terms of Application.cfc, this is very important as it happens on every single <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> request. The THIS variable scope of the Application.cfc is where our application is defined, and that definition basically is redefined on each request (as the constructor is executed on request, and outside of the application event handlers).\r\n\r\n\"But Cutter, what does that mean?\" Well, that\'s a good question. There are times when we want our application to stop and do something else. We don\'t want a new session started and taking up memory. We don\'t want a new application initialized (see the <a href=\"/index.cfm/2011/1/24/MSOC-Part-3-Setting-Up-Your-Applications\">last post</a> for an example). We don\'t want to even begin a request. By placing code within the constructor, the code will execute outside of these handlers, giving us the means to stop processing.\r\n\r\nSay you have two versions of a site: the standard version and a mobile version. Within the constructor we are already querying the database for details on the requested domain. Within the constructor you can run some code that says something like:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nif(!thisdomain.ismobile AND thisuseragent.ismobile){\r\n	location(url=\"http://\" & thisdomain.mobileUrl);\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nOr maybe you have multiple urls for the same site. You want them all to 301 redirect back to the primary site for SEO purposes. You could do something like:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nif(thisurl != thisdomain.primaryUrl){\r\n	location(url=\"http://\" & thisdomain.primaryUrl,statusCode=301);\r\n}\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nObviously you\'ll want to do a lot more than that, like including the requested template or any query string in the request, but there are a lot of uses. You just have to remember that constructor code processes prior to any of your application event handlers, and you don\'t want to bog it down too much as it will process on every ColdFusion request. Now you just have to get creative and decide <em>what</em> to do in your constructor. (What do you do in <em>your</em> constructor?)','MSOC-Pt4-Application-Constructor','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1527,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('F274F967-3048-71C2-17311FA7E9BD236A','MSOC Part 5: Application Event Handlers, An Intro','Handling the \"big picture\" application flow in <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion</a> is extremely easy, as a large part of it occurs directly in your application\'s <em>Application.cfc</em> file. Getting a handle on what\'s going on, in an MSOC app or any other app, is a matter of managing that application flow effectively. If you have a solid understanding of the event handlers available to you, then you can really begin to see the power behind ColdFusion\'s application framework.','2011-02-04 15:51:00','The ColdFusion Application Framework consists primarily of a single file, <em>Application.cfc</em>. When a request is made, ColdFusion will first look for an <em>Application.cfc</em> in the directory of the template requested. If one is not found, it will then traverse up each successive directory until it does find one, all the way up to your drive root if necessary. Once found, that is the application applied to that template request. This means that your <em>Application.cfc</em> file doesn\'t even need to be in the same directory as your site code. The <em>Application.cfc</em> can include several predefined methods that will automatically fire during key parts of application processing. We\'ll go more in depth of each set on future posts, but the gist of it is that there are methods that fire on the first request to an application, and when an application times out, when a new user session starts, and when it times out, and so on. This allows us to finely tailor how certain situations are handled during these important states of application life cycle. And, with careful planning, we can finely tune what our application memory footprint will do during that life cycle (which is highly important for an MSOC app) by carefully managing variables in their appropriate scopes.\r\n\r\n<h2>A Word On Scopes</h2>\r\n\r\nBack in the day, when the application framework was managed by Application.cfm, many developers spent a lot of time locking access to many persistent variables. This was a necessity, to one user\'s interactions from corrupting the data of another user\'s request. With Application.cfc, this headache is largely eliminated, because the ColdFusion server handles this locking for you during specific event processing. Here is a list of a some different scopes available for our use, and the event handlers that are associated with them in the application framework:\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n    	<li>APPLICATION - A scope to place variables that are available throughout the life of an active application.\r\n        	<ul>\r\n            	<li>onApplicationStart</li>\r\n                <li>onApplicationEnd</li>\r\n            </ul></li>\r\n        <li>SESSION - A scope to place variables that are available throughout the life of a specific user session, and only for that user session.\r\n        	<ul>\r\n            	<li>onSessionStart</li>\r\n                <li>onSessionEnd</li>\r\n            </ul></li>\r\n        <li>REQUEST - A scope to place variables that are available throughout the life of a specific request, and only within that request.\r\n        	<ul>\r\n            	<li>onRequestStart</li>\r\n                <li>onCFCRequest</li>\r\n                <li>onRequest</li>\r\n                <li>onRequestEnd</li>\r\n            </ul></li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\n Now, this isn\'t to say that you should never lock variable access. When operating within one scope\'s event handlers and accessing a different persistent scope, it is always a good idea to lock access to that foreign scope, especially when writing to that foreign scope. These scopes are the primary focus of these event handlers, but there are four other scopes to consider when working inside Application.cfc, just as in any other CFC:\r\n\r\n    <ul>\r\n    	<li>LOCAL - A function specific scope, whose variables are created, and only available, inside the function.</li>\r\n        <li>ARGUMENTS - A function specific scope of variables passed into the function.</li>\r\n        <li>VARIABLES - A CFC global variable scope. Variables in this scope are available throughout the entire CFC, and can be accessed and changed at any point. Use carefully.</li>\r\n        <li>THIS - This too is a CFC global variable scope, though it\'s values are typically publically available via an outside call on the object. (Application.cfc usage may be the exception, as you don\'t typically directly access Application.cfc as an object.)</li>\r\n    </ul>\r\n\r\nIn the case of normal CFC development, you would not want to access any persistent scope directly, working strictly with these last four scopes. If you needed access to a variable in the APPLICATION, SESSION, or REQUEST scopes (or even URL, CGI, FORM and CLIENT scopes), you would typically pass those value in to a CFC method as an argument. The <em>Application.cfc</em> is the one true exception to that rule.\r\n\r\nI hope that someone has found this little primer on the <em>Application.cfc</em> helpful.

 ('366CD9B6-3048-71C2-176FB3AC177D2D5D','MSOC Part 6: onApplication Event Handlers','In our <a href=\"/index.cfm/2011/2/4/MSOC-Part-5-Application-Event-Handlers-An-Intro\" target=\"_blank\">last MSOC post</a> we gave a brief introduction to the ColdFusion application framework\'s event handlers. With this post, we\'ll give a brief explanation of the onApplication handlers.\r\n\r\n<h2>onApplicationStart</h2>\r\n\r\nThe CFC constructor is the first thing that processes on a request, but the first request to an application will then run the onApplicationStart() method. This method will run prior to any other code in the request, and is your opportunity to setup variables in the shared APPLICATION scope. Within the onApplication handlers, you are able to manipulate the APPLICATION scope without being required to lock access to the scope, as no other process can access the variables until the method is completed, and preventing race conditions.\r\n\r\nThe APPLICATION scope is a where you place those variables you will use throughout the entire application. For instance, you may wish to keep a simple variable that holds the phone number for your Customer Support team, so that if the number changes it can instantly update throughout the site. The APPLICATION scope is also where you would store objects that you would use throughout your application, like a user or page manager.\r\n\r\n<h2>onApplicationEnd</h2>\r\n\r\nAs you might have guessed, this is the last method to fire during the lifetime of your application. In your constructor you would have set THIS.applicationTimeout. This is the length of time that the application will continue to live after it\'s last request. After this timeout limit is reached is when the onApplicationEnd will fire. This allows you to do some cleanup, or some application level logging. It is important to note that this only occurrs if the application does timeout. It will not fire if the server instance is shutdown/restarted.\r\n\r\n<h2>Consider This</h2>\r\n\r\nWhen you want to write to the APPLICATION scope from one of the other event handlers, you must lock access to prevent race conditions. You may, in your onServerStart method, have created a struct to log each active application (start up, last hit, timeout, number of sessions). When accessing the SERVER scope, you must also lock access.\r\n\r\nYou also have to heavily consider how much work you\'re putting into each of these event handlers, especially within the onApplicationStart. The more process you have there, the longer the startup time is for your application. It will be up to you just how much of a trade off that startup time is to the overall performance of your application.\r\n\r\nThe last thing you must consider (and I\'ll say this a lot during this series) is what variables and objects belong in what scopes. Remember that everything you place in the APPLICATION scope adds to the overall RAM utilization of that app. Everything you place in the SESSION scope will add to the overall RAM utilization of that session. This is especially important to consider in an MSOC environment. Try to think of it in these terms: the size of the SERVER scope + THE size of every APPLICATION + the size of every SESSION in every application must be less than the amount of RAM allocated to your ColdFusion instance. Careful planning is critical.\r\n\r\nIn our next piece we\'ll discuss the onSession event handlers. Hopefully you\'re finding this series beneficial. As always, any feedback/comments/questions are welcome.','2011-02-17 20:35:00',NULL,'MSOC-Part-6-onApplication-Event-Handlers','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1570,1,1,'','','','');

Hmmmm....','2011-02-27 12:15:00','So, we needed to replace any &amp;nbsp; that is preceded and followed by a printable character, leaving multiple concurrent &amp;nbsp; in tact for the fake indentation. I figured this was best left to a RegEx expression used in ColdFusion\'s ReReplace() method, but my RegEx is pretty rusty, so I reached out on Twitter.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.andymatthews.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Andy Matthews</a> and <a href=\"http://twitter.com/krisplus5\" target=\"_blank\">Kris Jones</a> both reached out to me with possible expressions for this, but nothing was working. What was happening is it was finding the characters around an &amp;nbsp; and removing both the nonbreaking space <em>and</em> the characters. Hmmmm....\r\n\r\nBut both of these folks had pointed me in the right direction. Seems in some RegEx replace engines you can reference <em>groups</em> within expressions in your replacement output. Unfortunately, you can\'t do this with ReReplace() (or if you can I haven\'t figured out how).\r\n\r\nSo I said to myself, \"Self\" (\'cause that\'s what I call myself) \"Self, what about tapping into ColdFusion\'s underlying Java?\" Fingers flying I hit Google. BAM! Up pops <a href=\"http://http://www.bennadel.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ben Nadel</a> talking pattern matching with the underlying java.util.regex package, with code examples all over (here\'s <a href=\"http://www.bennadel.com/blog/2094-Turning-Modes-On-And-Off-Within-A-Regular-Expression.htm\" target=\"_blank\">one</a>). Time to play.\r\n\r\nFirst I needed the Java RegEx Pattern object:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    CreateObject(\"java\",\"java.util.regex.Pattern\")\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThen I needed to define the pattern for which I was searching. This <a href=\"http://mindprod.com/jgloss/regex.html\" target=\"_blank\">RegEx Glossary</a> gave me a ton of info on Java RegEx, that I used to define my matching pattern:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    .compile(javaCast(\"string\",\"(\\p{Print})&amp;nbsp;(\\p{Print})\"))\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nthe \\p{Print} identifies any printable character (don\'t want to include my <br /> tags), and want only nonbreaking spaces bracketed by printable characters. The next step is defining the matcher (what the expression will be run against):\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    .matcher(javaCast(\"string\",REQUEST.matchThis))\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nAnd then, the final step, replacing the &amp;nbsp; with a space. The expression returns the characters as well, so I need group 1 + space + group 2 in my output (what I couldn\'t do in ReReplace). That RegEx Glossary helped with this too:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    .replaceAll(\"$1 $2\")\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nThe groups in the expression, the bits within parens (), are available to your output of the replaceAll by referencing that part of the expression\'s value. $1 for the first group, $2 for the second, and so on. The entire thing then looks something like this:\r\n\r\n<code>\r\n    REQUEST.finalValue =     CreateObject(\"java\", \"java.util.regex.Pattern\").compile(javaCast(\"string\", \"(\\p{Print})&amp;nbsp;(\\p{Print})\")).matcher(javaCast(\"string\", REQUEST.matchThis)).replaceAll(\"$1 $2\");\r\n</code>\r\n\r\nWorked like a charm!

 ('004CDA6E-3048-71C2-172E70A2500F1D40','Using The DataTables JQuery Plugin','For adminstrative applications, most of my readers know I\'m a huge proponent of the <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs\" target=\"_blank\">Ext JS</a> library. But for front-end, consumer facing sites, I\'m often pushed to use <a href=\"http://www.jquery.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery</a>. JQuery is very light weight, and wonderful for DOM manipulation, but it isn\'t a component library. When you want widgets for advanced data display, you have to use something like <a href=\"http://www.jqueryui.com\" target=\"_blank\">JQueryUI</a>. Unfortunately, JQueryUI doesn\'t yet have a grid component (though <a href=\"http://blog.jqueryui.com/2011/02/unleash-the-grid/\" target=\"_blank\">they are working on it</a>). So when I recently needed a dynamic, paging data grid, I started looking for something that used server-side data requests and could be skinned using the <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/themeroller/\" target=\"_blank\">ThemeRoller</a>. That\'s when I came upon the <a href=\"http://www.datatables.net\" target=\"_blank\">DataTables</a> plugin.\r\n\r\nIt took me some time to figure out the works of how the plugin makes server-side requests. What I found was that, by default the plugin passes an extreme amount of data on a request, and not typically in a format very conducive for our needs. I also had to find a way to pass the method name and data returnFormat needed. That\'s when I discovered that I could override it\'s default request. Once I figured that out, I wrote a method to parse the data to create a request object more conducive to a ColdFusion Component request. It passes the following arguments along in a request:\r\n\r\n             <ul>\r\n			<li>iDisplayStart - The number of the first record in the requested set.</li>\r\n			<li>iDisplayLength - The number of records to return in the requested set.</li>\r\n			<li>sEcho - A DataTables request identifier, to be echoed back with the return.</li>\r\n			<li>aoSort - If present, this will be a JSON string representation of sort columns and orders. It\'s an array of objects:\r\n				<ul>\r\n					<li>colName - the column name</li>\r\n					<li>sortDir - the sort direction (asc|desc)</li>\r\n				</ul></li>\r\n		</ul>\r\n\r\nAfter getting data to my CFC, I had to build my paging query. For my example here I wanted to use the MySQL database I use for my blog, so this was a learning experience for me. The biggest trick for me was getting the TotalCount of records, as this is extremely different from MS SQL, requiring two separate SQL statements for the query and the count. Since DataTables can also sort off of different columns, I needed a way to dynamically set the ORDER BY clause of the query. You can\'t bind parameters to the ORDER BY clause, but you want to protect your server from SQL injection attack, so you have to validate that part of the request (especially as it\'s an ajax request, which would be easier to manipulate). <a href=\"http://www.petefreitag.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pete Frietag</a> came up with a little regex expression that could be used in this case.\r\n\r\nWe set up our component to return a structure in the following format:\r\n		<ul>\r\n			<li>success - A boolean to denote success or failure of the request.</li>\r\n			<li>message - Only returned if the request fails, a message to state why the failure occurred.</li>\r\n			<li>totalCount - The total number of records available for the filters applied.</li>\r\n			<li>result - The paging query.</li>\r\n		</ul>\r\n\r\nThe last piece of the puzzle was back on the client-side again, where the ColdFusion return had to be put back into a format that can be consumed by the DataTables plugin. This was actually very easy because of the way that ColdFusion returns query data.\r\n\r\nOnce I had these methods, I wanted to find out how to write a feature plugin for DataTables. One where I could identify additional config arguments in DataTables, and have it automatically work. I contacted <a href=\"http://www.sprymedia.co.uk/\" target=\"_blank\">Allan Jardine</a>, who wrote DataTables (and has some great web dev tools on his site). He never wrote in that capability, saying that the method override was the only way to make this happen. What I did discover was that I could add options to the standard DataTables config. I created a new option for DataTables, oCFReaderDT, which takes an object of options. Only one argument is required, \"method\", to define the method to call in the CFC request. I also setup the processor to accept an option, \"sForm\", as a string selector of a form whose values you may need in the request (i.e.: \'form#myForm\'). Then I wrote a custom function that encapsulated the previously written methods into one method, that could then be used as the value of the \"fnServerData\" option in the DataTables configuration object.\r\n\r\nIn the download link below is a zip file with all of the files for the <a href=\"http://examples.cutterscrossing.com/DataTables\" target=\"_blank\">example</a>, which has been heavily commented so you know what\'s going on.

Each tale is unique, and this one is mine. My discovery of <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/\">ColdFusion</a> was a blessing, leading to a great life and fulfilling career of fantastic experiences with outstanding friends, acquaintances, and mentors. Here\'s how it started for me....\r\n\r\nIn the early nineties I was stationed at Ft. Meade, MD, working for the National Security Agency. Professional Development is a key thing in the military. We were expected to constantly learn and foster new skills that might help us do our jobs better. Being interested in computers at an early age, I started taking classes on computer systems and, having a background in linguistics, once again became fascinated with computer programming, taking classes in C and C++.\r\n\r\nThis new thing called \"the internet\" was becoming a big deal around the office. On my first PC, in the barracks, I was becoming a junky of Prodigy (then AOL, then my first ISP...) and learning to master \'search\' through Alta Vista. At work someone asked me to create a \'web page\' for our department on our local intranet. NCSA Mosaic was rapidly being replaced with Netscape Navigator, and updates to HTML had introduced new tags, like TABLE and IMG. Things were changing rapidly.\r\n\r\nI started teaching myself HTML. Compared to \'programming languages\', HTML was a walk in the park, though a bit frustrating in it\'s layout limitations. The internet was really becoming a big thing, and I thought I was ahead of the curve. I could make a living doing this? Wow, that would be cool! I had been in the Army for almost a decade. Still young, and single, with no kids, I had been thinking it was time to move on in the world. The Army had been good to me, but I thought I could do more, be more, back in the civilian world. (Mental Note: kick self later for being young and dumb)\r\n\r\nI became friends with a guy who owned a screenprinting and advertising specialties company in southern Delaware. I created a quick web site for them, which helped them get some state funding for growth and expansion. They offered me a job, leading me to believe that my new skills could help them augment their corporate branding offerings to another level. After a brief assignment overseas, I put in paperwork to get out of the Army, packed up my stuff, and moved to the Eastern Shore to start a new life and career.\r\n\r\nThings didn\'t quite work out as planned. The company really wanted someone to sell product to the military, develop paperwork automation processes in the office, and help out with \'production\' (printing T-Shirts and stuff). Transitioning from military life to civilian life isn\'t always easy, and I had trapped myself in a strange place, with no real friends, in a job that wasn\'t going anywhere. I did this for three years, working 18+ hour days for next-to-nothing, becoming more and more disillusioned and watching myself slide behind the curve again. I had taught myself Visual Basic for Applications, tying together workflow between different MS Office applications, but my web development advancement had grown stale, being relegated to maintaining the company website with MS FrontPage (shiver). Then the best thing happened, I was layed off. The company decided they really needed a salesman more than a computer guru.\r\n\r\nUnemployment has the fortunate by-product of forcing one to do the things they <em>need</em> to do. I knew that I loved computers, and had a talent for languages. I needed to get back to those things. For two months I called Manpower everyday, hauling stuff around warehouses or working in a buddies garage changing oil and tires, while scanning the want ads. Finally, I saw an ad for a Corporate Support Specialist with a regional Internet Service Provider. I went in for the interview, they gave me a test (on ColdFusion), and I failed. I didn\'t know the language, didn\'t have much for reference, and bombed it.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the interviewer saw some potential. They referred me up to the manager of the Tech Support team. He was a retired Army guy himself, and had an open position in his department. The thought was, bring me in, learn the ropes and the business, and work on increasing my skills until I could transition to development. Now we\'re talking! I didn\'t make much, but it was more than the screenprinting company, better than being unemployed doing odd jobs, and it was getting back on track. I jumped on it.\r\n\r\nI was a good Tech Support rep. We talked 70 year old ladies through manually creating a Windows Dialer to dial into our service. We talked 80 year old men through setting up and using email. Yes, that TV looking thing in front of you is called a \'monitor\' and, no, that is not a cupholder (seriously). Things were pretty smooth, and I wasn\'t on the phone all the time, so I started brushing back up on web dev skills. I got on a mailing list to learn JavaScript (which had passed me by til then). I started playing with DHTML, and this new thing called CSS (Layout! Hot Damn!) To make it worthwhile, I created the first real FAQ for the ISP; a set of interactive, online tutorials for the basic tasks we always talked about on the phone (setting up email programs, configuring browser settings, etc.)\r\n\r\nThis was all good, but wasn\'t getting me moved to Corporate Support. I took on a real challenge on my own. I got a copy of Visual Studio from the college, and began to create a dialer application for the company. I had already gotten up to speed on the changes in HTML, picked up better than passable skills in JavaScript, and was fairly good with CSS. Now I needed to dig in deeper into <em>programming</em>, so I started learning Visual Basic (not a big jump from VBA), then InstallShield scripting, which in turn led to diving back in to C++. Four months later the ISP was pressing it\'s own CD\'s of the dialer app for distribution to new clients. And, they were hiring again in the Corporate Support department.\r\n\r\nDelmarva Online was a small regional Internet Service Provider, with about 14,000 dialup clients, that also ran a small hosting business. They hosted roughly 600 corporate sites for everything from churches to school districts to car dealerships and small manufacturing companies. In it\'s earliest days they had used a server-side technology called IHTML, and by the time I moved into Corporate Support they still had one or two clients on that platform. But the majority of their clients were on something called ColdFusion, a server-side technology built on C++ by a company called Allaire. Coming in to Corporate Support, my job was similar to that of Tech Support; walking clients through email configuration and stuff. But, I also got the responsibility of taking on minor coding tasks to hosted sites, slowly learning ColdFusion.\r\n\r\nHaving started on-line classes for Computer Science, with the University of Maryland University College, I was really getting in to Object Oriented Programming. .NET was in beta at this point, and I was thinking that it was going to be \'the thing\', but I was getting better and better everyday with ColdFusion. Our lead programmer, Joel Firestone, had taken his hobby site for guitar (<a href=\"http://www.guitarists.net\">Guitarists.net</a>) to a new level, getting it mentioned in <em>Guitar Player</em> magazine. Pretty cool for a site that had taken a few months of \"spare time\" to develop in ColdFusion (Joel moved to PHP later in life, and has since moved his site to that as well, but that\'s another story). We had one or two sites on ASP that had taken me forever to implement easy stuff, like mail, that took me seconds in ColdFusion. I really started to pick it up, combining ColdFusion with JavaScript, CSS and XHTML. They started giving me small apps to write, then full site rewrites. ColdFusion 5 was released, and UDF\'s were the new rage, then Blackstone started talking about CFC\'s, and I quickly started seeing full Object Oriented web development on the horizon. ColdFusion was moving to a Java EE server, and the changes were awesome!\r\n\r\nJump ahead a decade. Wow, how times have changed! ColdFusion has changed hands twice (from Allaire to Macromedia to Adobe), and has gotten better and better with each iteration. I\'ve watched ColdFusion grow with the web, and continually been amazed by the things that have been done. I\'ve had the opportunity to play with close to a dozen server-side technologies in that time, and always come back to ColdFusion for the core of my work. It does far more than just pay the bills, and I\'m never short of work, and thank God every day for the opportunities that have come my way this past decade. ColdFusion development (and developers) change and grow every day. Millions of sites with outdated code are being upgraded, or rewritten, to more modern development standards. ColdFusion is an incredibly easy language to learn and use, which also makes it easy to write bad code as well. Today we see developers apply new skills and standards towards writing scalable and efficient code, which highlights the ROI of ColdFusion development in that those upgrades and rewrites are accomplished in a fraction of the time (and cost, and resources) than it would take in many competing technologies. The web\'s first web application server platform and language has proven itself as an enterprise ready rapid application development platform, and modern developers are proving it, time and again, as a real world solution toward answering real business needs rapidly and effectively.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen great frameworks come about, outstanding public (and private) sites, Web Services enter the fray and change and grow, ColdFusion developers (historically server-side people) embrace JavaScript and Ajax, mobile become the new hotness, Open Source projects multiply and grow and grow and grow... It\'s an exciting time to work on the web, and just as exciting to work with such a dynamic technology as ColdFusion. I can\'t wait to see what comes next!','2011-08-01 11:47:00',NULL,'How-Did-I-Get-Started-With-ColdFusion','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',714,1,1,'','','',''),
 ('C3A5F9F4-3048-71C2-172FCB7FD01CAFF9','New Job, New Home, A Lot of Work','It\'s been a very busy year, up til now. Work ramped up in February, contracting me for additional hours for a month and a half straight, after which I\'ve worked on a sting of side projects. This helped me finance a move to Jacksonville, Florida. My new (daytime) job is full-time telecommute, which allows me to put my desk anywhere. Teresa wanted to get back to sunshine and beaches, being tired of the cold and snow of Tennessee winters, and chose Jacksonville for it\'s location and proximity to family and friends. Jacksonville is a great area, and we nailed a terrific place in Fleming Island. I like it because there\'s lots of tech (user groups and such), and it\'s not far from other tech centers (Orlando, Tampa, Atlanta, etc). It doesn\'t hurt that I can maintain a year around tan or that the beach is a short drive away.\r\n\r\nA lot of work has come my way, often tacking an additional 40 to 60 hours a week on top of my normal day job schedule. Often I\'ll take a project that takes a week or two, then take a few weeks off to spend with the family (and <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/cutterbl\" target=\"_blank\">catch up on my reading</a>). I have a list of posts I need to write, due to exposure to some projects I hadn\'t previously been exposed to. Part of that <a href=\"/index.cfm/2011/2/7/Using-The-DataTables-JQuery-Plugin\">already started</a> with some exposure to the <a href=\"http://www.datatables.net/\" target=\"_blank\">DataTables</a> JQuery plugin, but I\'m also lining up posts for <a href=\"http://www.trirand.com/jqgridwiki/doku.php?id=wiki:jqgriddocs\" target=\"_blank\">jqGrid</a>, <a href=\"http://www.jstree.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jsTree</a>, and the <a href=\"http://cfuniform.riaforge.org/\" target=\"_blank\">cfUniForm</a> project. <a href=\"http://www.evernote.com\" target=\"_blank\">Evernote</a> is filling up with little tidbits. The most difficult piece is coming up with the time to write examples. I\'m particular about writing well formed code and documentation, which is why my posts sometimes get spaced out a bit.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I have discovered, in my exposure to these other projects, is how much I miss working with <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/products/extjs/\" target=\"_blank\">Ext JS</a> day-to-day. <a href=\"http://jqueryui.com/\" target=\"_blank\">JQuery UI</a> is a good project, but lacks the maturity of Ext JS, and is missing too many key components for writing web <em>applications</em> (Data Stores, Grid, Tree, Menus, Tooltips, etc). My exposure to those other projects was an attempt to fill needs for which Ext JS would have been better suited, while locked into using JQuery UI. The JQuery UI team is working on closing that gap, but there is a lot of catch up necessary to match the breadth and power of Ext JS.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Ext JS, <a href=\"http://www.packtpub.com\" target=\"_blank\">Packt Publishing</a> asked me to write the next Ext JS book on my own. While very flattered, I had to carefully weigh what that commitment would mean. Ultimately, I could not justify committing seven and a half months to writing the book with all of the other responsibilities I have right now. I will write a few articles for Packt (as part of my contract on the <a href=\"https://www.packtpub.com/learning-ext-js-3-2-for-building-dynamic-desktop-style-user-interfaces/book\" target=\"_blank\">last book</a>), but feel like I can continue to create blog content that would be more timely (no six month editorial process) and have a greater reach, and do so as my schedule permits without being a burden on my family. <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com\" target=\"_blank\">Sencha</a> has already announced <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/what-to-expect-in-ext-js-4-1/\" target=\"_blank\">What to Expect in Ext JS 4.1</a>, and recently put <a href=\"http://www.sencha.com/blog/ext-designer-1-2-beta/\" target=\"_blank\">Ext Designer 1.2 in Beta</a>, so there\'s a lot to talk about here.\r\n\r\nLast, but definitely not least, I\'m following all the buzz about the upcoming <a href=\"http://blogs.adobe.com/coldfusion/2011/06/08/next-version-of-coldfusion-is-codenamed-zeus/\" target=\"_blank\">ColdFusion \"Zeus\"</a>. A quick <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=coldfusion+zeus\" target=\"_blank\">Google Search</a> already brings up a ton of info that <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com\" target=\"_blank\">Adobe</a> has put out regarding the next version of the ColdFusion server platform, and it looks to once again be a significant release. Some of the big things already mentioned have been the move from JRun to Tomcat, the retirement of Verity in favor of Solr, the upgrade to Axis 2, and the inclusion of closures in CFML. That\'s just some of what\'s coming, as Adobe appears to be giving more and more detail during the various conferences through the year (and you never know the whole story until it\'s released).','2011-08-13 10:54:00',NULL,'New-Job-New-Home-A-Lot-of-Work','cutterbl','Default',1,'',0,'',1278,1,1,'','','','');
